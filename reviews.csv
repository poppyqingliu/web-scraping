Kimberly R.,"Arlington, VA",9/15/2017,4.0,"This is my father-in-laws favorite place to eat when my in-laws are in town, and quite frankly the best Korean/Asian food we've had so far. This place is always busy even during the non-peak hours. And because it is busy, sometimes things get lost in translation and the waitress forgets or doesn't hear any additional requests. Last time we had to remind our waitress to bring out two more miso soups several times and it didn't come until we were all nearly done with our meals. This might be a small hiccup but other than that service and food has always been great. For newbies: try coming during a non-peak hour time to enjoy what the restaurant has to offer. The restaurant is a little cramped but once you've had the food you wouldn't care how tight the atmosphere is. Faves: Bulgogi, anything from the sushi bar, Galbi, And the scallion egg pancake thing I can't remember the name for"
Nanoreeftank N.,"Fairfax, VA",9/10/2017,4.0,"My friends and I have grown to loves the Korean BBQ and have been trying many different K restaurant around the Annandale area in VA for years. As far as I can remember this restaurant have been here for years going back as far as in the 80s and may even be much longer before I relocated to this area. There are many choice when it come to Korean restaurant but this is come at the top of my list as the first and only choice. The place is open 24 hours and there is always a line and a good 30 mins wait during dinner in Fri and Sat. The price is very reasonable, the foods are in a good portion. I love their many condiments come in many varieties.   Dont worry if you need more because they are always happy to bring more without telling you they will charge extra for more like some other restaurant i have been to. If you like spicy food, go for the yukgaejang is a shred beef soup and broth base. If you have a large group of six or more, go with the yechon special #3 that can serve up to 4 or 6 which include , beefs, chicken, pork, shrimp and a whole lobsters. If you are more on the food adventure side, go for the Heumetgul (cant get the exact spelling) which is a thin slide beef tongue that cook at you table and dip with sea salt oil, this taste just like beef and much leaner in my opinion. Their fish disks are also good choice if you like fish. I usually come here for dinner but their lunch menu and price is also not bad. Ok so let talk about service: some reviewer had wrote they got bad services but i have to beg for you differ here.  Understand many of the servers does not speak perfect English but they are friendly, tentative and know their foods. If you are walking into the restaurant expecting them to make suggestion or recommendation than you are a newbies to K foods and you may find your self lost so i would s suggest check out their online menu rather than asking these servers to tell you. My friend and i love this place, their foods and also had grown to know many of the wonderful ladies that work here and they also remember our usual orders. I would recommend you try it and decide for your self if this can make your food list"
Cristel Y.,"Washington, DC",8/28/2017,3.0,"Food quality = 4Customer service = 2This place is amazing because they are open 24 hours. That means that midnight cravings can always be fulfilled. The restaurant had all types of Korean food. From soups, to kbbq, to my favorite sashimi salad.The only downfall is that you feel extremely rushed to eat. For the many times I've been here, I come out feeling sick. Staff is of course overwhelmed and as a customer you are a recipient of their stress. Service is poor but sadly I still come back! Can never go wrong with a place that serves a wide variety of Korean food."
Aimee L.,"Arlington, VA",8/18/2017,4.0,"Apparently this place is 24/7 so I would definitely come back for late night noms. It's super Korean and has a lot of options, but for the kbbq, you can only pick certain meats because they won't let you change metal plates to cook the meat on...so you can't do beef brisket and pork belly or something so sad. My group got two meats for kbbq, the glass noodles (forgot what they're called), and the fried dumplings. THE DUMPLINGS WERE SO GOOD DEFINITELY GET. Apparently they're known for their dumpling soup so I guess that makes sense. Also had a large variety of sides."

Updated review",4.0,"Back again. We went here this time because my sister wanted bbq and the rest of my family wanted other options. With the expectation of good bbq in mind, I would say it went down a notch for me. I partially expected to be able to cook my own bbq since I've done it before at another restaurant and really liked having control over how my meat is cooked. We weren't given a choice, and while I wasn't surprised that they had a server cook for us, I didn't dig it. My sister was looking forward to trying to cook hers for the first time, too, so she was a bit disappointed. Since we weren't given the choice and the servers actually (with what I sensed was a bit of annoyance) corrected us when we moved the grill (back when we still thought we would get to cook it) to the middle of the table, we were too intimidated to ask for clarification. I didn't dig the service this time. The meats were tender and pretty delicious, but did I think the pricing was good for how much meat we got? Not really. You're better off deciding as a group that you're all going to get bbq and then going to another place that is dedicated to AYCE bbq. For balance between bbq and regular dishes, it's fine here. To get it cooked fresh at your table, you'd have to get multiple things from the bbq menu, so keep that in mind--especially when galbi was $29.99 for about 15 small pieces? I remember us getting 3/person and there were 5 of us. I'm telling you the pricing here so you can decide if that's acceptable, since their website doesn't have pricing and I couldn't find any in the yelp photos. The less expensive bbq dishes hover around $18.99. With the requirement to get at least 2, you do the math.Overall, the food is still delicious, the ban chan was still great and fresh, and the service (aside from the bbq part) was still attentive. My experience this time might have been a 3-3.5, but considering the overall package, I'd still give this place a 4."
Damon B.,"Iowa City, IA",9/13/2017,4.0,"This is a really cool place to go and have some interesting and traditional food. I find that it's best to go with friends as the servings are big and sometimes you have to have a minimum number of orders to get an item. I liked the service style. Get a drink and food order, then leave you alone with your friends and food. You won't have your waitress asking you how the food is every two minutes.I would recommend this place for sure."
Edward H.,"McLean, VA",8/4/2017,5.0,"Been here probably more than 30x in my life. This restaurant has been here for over 10+ years and is one of the older Korean restaurants in Annnandale. It's still around so that's a statement in itself. I'm korean, and a foodie, so that makes me especially a Korean food snob. Yechon is a convenient, 24-hour, slightly above average Korean restaurant that serves a wide variety of dishes. One thing I really like about the restaurant is that it also has great lunch specials for very affordable prices. They also have decent lunch box options which is a nice variety for cheap. To compare it to an American chain, its sorta like the Korean Cheesecake Factory. When you go into a Korean restaurant, you need to know what to order. Certain restaurants are good at certain dishes. Since I've been here so many times, I can let you know some of the better dishes I've had here:Soondoobu - delicious tofu soup. It hurts to say it, but I like this tofu soup better than Tofu lighthouse (Vit Goel). The broth tastes better and the tofu quality is better. Haejang-guk - also known as ""hangover soup"". This is one of the better dishes here, especially since it's also on the lunch special menu for like $7.95. It's a soup that consists of vegetables and beef in a hearty beef broth. Kimchi jiggae- kimchi soup, probably one of my favorite kimchi jiggae's in Annandale. Gopchang-jeongol - beef intestine soup (I know it sounds gross but the broth here is probably the best intestine stew you can find in the Annandale area)I don't usually get any korean BBQ here since there are many restaurants in Annandale that specialize in that so I never understood why anybody would get korean BBQ here of all places."
Soohyun Y.,"Mountain View, CA",5/29/2017,4.0,"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in the Tristate area.Side DishesThey have a good variety of side dishes. Solid kimchi and Korean omelette ().Main DishesThis is a great place for those not familiar with Korean food. You can't go wrong with the grilled meat. I'd like to make some recommendations because it might be difficult for you to order if you're not familiar with the menu. I'll start off with grilled meat and venture into other areas.MEAT (Korean BBQ)1. Samgyeopsal - pork belly2. Chadolbaegi - thinly sliced beef brisket, great as a first round of meat because it cooks really fast3. Yechon Special Jumulryeok - this is my favorite. It's marinated beef that's a bit sweet and moist.BASICSIf you're Korean and you're feeling the usual, the bibimbap and soups are solid.SEAFOODIf you're feeling adventurous and don't mind fishy foods, I recommend the Daegu Maeuntang. It's what Koreans call ""cool/refreshing"" because it's so spicy that it feels like your heart is opening up and you're liberated. This is the best I can translate :PAPPETIZERSSeafood pancake. It's huge, so order it with a big group or expect to take it home.OTHERI haven't had the sushi, but I don't recommend going to a Korean restaurant and ordering sushi.Ambiance/ServiceKorean LOL. Very busy, not amazing service in the American sense, but decent/expected service from a Korean's perspective."

Updated review",4.0,"Still stand by my 2009 review - very good pan chan, very fresh lettuce served with the bulgogi, a fine bowl of dumpling soup.  Good service but the waitresses are very busy and there's a little language barrier.  But I came away feeling very well fed - and at a very reasonable price. They've added parking but the lot still fills up quickly."
Justin C.,"Washington, DC",8/3/2017,4.0,"The hype is real. I came here full of skepticism because 1) I've been disappointed by way too many Korean places in Annandale that have great Yelp reviews and 2) Yechon's menu has like 9458 items on it so I assumed not everything could be good (although Cheesecake Factory also has 39585 items and most of their dishes are surprisingly tasty...hmmm). Anyways, the wait unfortunately was also very real as mentioned by other people. I guess this is the ""it"" place for Korean food in VA. Wait wasn't terrible though....like 30min?I'm a big fan of hanboks (Korean traditional dresses) so it was cool to see the waitresses dressed in them. The food here is pretty solid. I wouldn't say it's mind-blowing and I didn't experience any foodgasms, but I was extremely satisfied at finally getting really homey Korean food. We got a soup, bibimbop and spicy seafood dish and all were flavorful and tasty. I'm glad I now have a go-to spot for Korean food....when I have some time to spare to wait to get seated."
Star K.,"Washington, DC",5/24/2017,3.0,It's 24/7 so it's convenient for veryyyy late night fixThe meals are alright Service can get slow depending on how many people are working at the kitchen.
PHAN D.,"Fairfax, VA",7/28/2017,2.0,Service is really slipping at this Annandale landmark restaurant. Long waits to put in your order in a half full restaurant. Food is pretty good but not the best in this town. Disappointing overall.
Arjun R.,"Arlington, VA",7/6/2017,4.0,"This is an overwhelming menu if you are into Korean food.  However, some classics like tteobeoki are missing.  But there is a lot to like here like mandu, bibimbap, and all the kbbq standards that you would expect.  There is also a pretty decent sushi selection.  Rolls, nigiri, and sashimi and all of it is tasty but not exceptional.  The lunch box deals seem to be the best value, $10-14 for a sizeable portion of BBQ meat plus a little salad soup sushi and Korean side dishes.  They don't serve these on holidays or weekend.Sushi here is tasty and the bbq is really good as well.  I found the japchae to be kind of bland and the banchan were a little boring.  But this is a solid offering and is basically always open so give it a try!"
Edmund L.,"Arlington, VA",4/12/2017,4.0,"One of the top late night Korean restaurants in the Northern Virginia area and a favorite of mine since I was an undergrad in college.You'll notice this restaurant standing out with it's neon sign across from Little River Turnpike. It's a popular late night drunk spot for the young asian crowd. Whatever you decide to order the servers will bring over a plethora of banchan (appetizer side dishes) I recommend the dried baby fish and cold mashed potatoes. For the main dish..the most popular ones are the Korean BBQ entrees such as the galbi and bulgogi. I've always been a fan of the galbi (marinated short ribs) as it is such a juicy and tender piece of meat.In terms of price..it is on the pricier end as a dish averages to be around $20. I know people say there are much better Korean restaurants in Annandale than Yechon but as a late night spot it can't be beat...I prefer it over Honey Pig. The only complaint is the servers here aren't very attentive which seems common among restaurants run by the older Korean population. However, if you're looking for a good place to eat in Northern Va after a night of drinking, this place is highly recommended."
So U.,"Alexandria, VA",7/28/2017,3.0,"8pm Friday night after a long day at work, I wanted cold beer, soju and Korean BBQ. Unfortunately for us, Kogiya didn't have a table available until for 2.5 hours when called to be put on the waiting list. After thinking of options nearby, we decided on Yechon. To make a long story short -- the haemul pajeon was great, no problem there. Their Yechon Special Galbi was a different story. When the lady brought it out, it was not steaming, not sizzling, and the hot plate was not hot at all. Why did they go through the theatrics of serving it on a hot plate if it wasn't sizzling in the first place?  The bone-in portion of the meat was warm to the touch.  (Literally, I was holding the bone in my hand...easily handled). The hot plate was touchable, meaning it wasn't even close to hot. I wasn't disappointed. I was mad because it felt like they were trying to pull a fast one on me. Why the theatrics?  The hot plate was warm. The meat looked like it's been sitting there for a while. No visible steam. No audio feedback. Just flaccid, gray meat! Maybe an erroneous order for another customer recycled to fulfill mine?  So many scenarios racing through my mind. I've been to countless Korean BBQ restaurants in the past but never have I experienced a serving of lukewarm galbi. I give them three stars for the service because the lady who saw me touching the hot plate understood immediately that we were not happy with the dish. After an offer to bring out a fresh plate of galbi and my subsequent refusal (because I was ready to leave at that point) she returned with the bill with the galbi taken off. High expectations, thoroughly disappointed."
Jackie C.,"San Francisco, CA",6/20/2017,2.0,"I know Yechon is a favorite for many folks in the nova area, but I personally have not had good experiences during the times I went. This most recent visit was similar to past ones. The pros are that Yechon is 24/7, much better parking than in the past, and diverse types of Korean and Japanese food to choose from. Unfortunately, the cons list is much longer. Service is terrible here. I don't blame the workers, as I can see they need more servers and are heavily overworked. But it does cause unhappy customers as well. Half of my family got their dishes in a reasonable amount of time, and the other dishes still did not coming out after 45 minutes! We asked the servers several times where the rest of the dishes were, and it was very apparent that the other dishes were forgotten and not made.. it finally came out an hour from being seated. It was hard to request more side dishes or even ask for water refills as the servers rarely came by our table. Again, I understand it was extremely busy and the servers were overworked. But something should be done about it and they should hire more servers.On top of that, I personally do not think the food is good. Maybe it's me being Korean-American and having a high standard for Korean food, but I would rather get my Korean food elsewhere. I ordered a galbi-jjim bento box. Most of the galbi-jjim had fat covered around it, the salad was extremely old lettuce and super soggy, and the tempura vegetables were rock hard. Not very appetizing to me. I would suggest a different restaurant in Annandale if you want authentic Korean food."
Fred K.,"Rockville, MD",1/25/2017,4.0,"Been going here for decades as it is the closest Korean restaurant off 495 and is open 24 hours a day.  From my earlier party/clubbing days and eating late night eats (spicy chap chae and dubu kimchi!) to now my more docile family man life, this place is usually very consistent with their food quality with good size portions. Not to mention, there quantity and quality of their banchan is better here than most (love them korean style mashed potatoes!). I usually get their yuk kwe jung(spicy beef soup) or spicy galbitang soup when coming here.  Cant go wrong with either dishes. They also have a full sushi counter and a limited Japanese menu (teriyaki and udon soup).  If coming here for lunch, they have both korean and sushi bento boxes and a separate korean lunch menu too, that is slightly cheaper than their regular menu. They expanded their parking lot finally!  Ample parking for this restaurant now.  The servers speak and understand English fairly well too, so good for novice to eating Korean cuisine.  Solid, good place if in the mood for Korean food."
Mary N.,"Alexandria, VA",6/25/2017,4.0,"The good:Friendly wait staffBanchan for daysReasonable pricingThe bad:Interior needs updatingNot the highest quality meatAn excessively large menu As far as 24 hour joints go, Ye Chon ranks pretty high for me. The food quality is pretty good and fresh, although the meat isn't the best in the world (it's not bad, however). They have a really large variety of banchan, all of which is pretty good, though their kimchi is a little on the chewy side. On our most recent visit, my husband and I ordered:BulgogiChicken teriyakiCalifornia rollI'm kind of sad the bulgogi is cooked in the kitchen rather than tableside, but I guess I don't need theatrics at every meal. The chicken teriyaki was quite good, and the broccoli served with it was super fresh. The California roll was exceptionally average, and I'm not sure I'd order sushi in the future. One of the leaves of lettuce served to me had a small (living) insect on it, and when I brought it to the server's attention, she was very apologetic and got me new lettuce. I'm unphased by things like that because produce gets bugs sometimes. I washed bugs out of my lettuce just the other day, and I appreciated her quickness to rectify the situation (if we can even call it that). I'd like to try other menu items in the future, but I can definitely recommend the bulgogi or Chadolbaegi (cooked tableside)."
Marivic L.,"Washington, DC",2/6/2017,4.0,"Yechon has been my (and a lot of other peeps') go-to Korean place for a while now and you know it when you try to get a seat here on a Saturday, but you wait because you know the service is friendly and attentive and the food is consistent. This time, we got the special galbi (as usual), some sushi  , and fish which I think was croaker. The fish was a new dish for me here and it was flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get it again.So, once again the service was good, the old standbys were delicious and now I have another dish that I can count on."
Justin P.,"Silver Spring, MD",3/17/2017,4.0,"Great spot to eat! Open 24 hours which makes it even better! A Korean friend of mine told us about this spot, ordered our food for us and it was definitely way different from your traditional KBBQ spot. They do have BBQ options to choose from, but we ordered some stuff where you can order as a ""family style"" portions and dishes for people to just pass around and share. I am definitely not sure what it was called but it was basically lettuce wraps with different toppings or things to add per wrap. Then we got Japji Korean noodles, bulgogi, and some other soup too. Just take a look at the pictures I post.This place doesnt disappoint. You will of course get your sides and rice and all. But I will definitely come back."

Only came before because they are open late and I hadn't discovered all the other great Korean restaurants of Annandale. Their food is mediocre. Service is horrible. This has been the ONLY restaurant I have been to in my entire life where the server TOLD US WE HAD TO LEAVE. We did nothing wrong. We ate, asked for the check, paid our check, and we were talking about where to get dessert as our server comes over, collects our checks and tells us we have to go because they are on a wait. We hadn't even been sitting for longer than a minute from when she gave us our check back. LIKE SERIOUSLY? Who does that?!? Not to mention they were cleaning our table as we are STILL SITTING THERE!

Faye C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/28/2017,2.0,"Such a disappointment. Stop by here on our way to Shenandoah national park since it has such great reviews but it was a huge disappointment. When we arrived to the restaurant it was packed but we only had to wait 15 minutes. We finally got sat and was So excited to try the food.   My friend and I ordered raw beef (yuk hwae), squid stir fry and Galbitang (short rib soup). Only thing that was good was the side dishes (banchans). The yuk whae was prepared differently than I was used too but I thought it was their own way of making it but as I keep eating yuk whae smothered in gochujang, I really didn't understand why it was prepared this way. The soup was flavorless and the stir fry was okay. Maybe because I am Korean and I know how certain food should taste like but this place was such a disappointment"

Cindy L.,"Washington, DC",4/30/2017,3.0,"I get that staying open 24 hours is a huge draw especially since most of the smaller restaurants in Annandale close around 10pm, but I've been here twice now and am not quite sure I understand the hype or popularity of this place...Most of the food I've ordered has just been so-so. I've tried one of the casseroles, which was kinda bland not to mention had a super high intestine-to-everything-else ratio. At one point it felt like every bite was just a mouthful of intestine... Also had their galbi and beef tongue for kbbq - wasn't too impressed with either one. It was pricey for the amount and quality of the meats. I'd recommend Oegadgib/Kogiya (all you can eat) or Honey Pig for better value and taste kbbq.To end on a high note though, their bo ssam and seafood pancakes were pretty delicious!"
Yujin H.,"Fairfax, VA",12/23/2016,3.0,"Friday dinner, my mom and I decided to stop by yechon. We got the yechon special menu 1 which includes sashimi, dumpling soup, korean short ribs, mung bean pancake, mackerel, bean paste stew, and healthy rice.The place was packed and it took a little bit before we got seated. The food was overall good but we could probably find other restaurants near by that could do everything better than they do. However, it's not often I can find some place that does course work like yechon does. My biggest complaint is customer service. We were given one menu between the two of us and we felt so rushed to order. The ladies are running around frantically and the environment is just so hectic. It definitely wasn't a comfortable meal and we weren't checked on at all. The only thing yechon can boast is it being 24/7. Honestly when you walk in, half the customers at the restaurant aren't korean and that should already be signs that they're not really good at specializing; they're just good at providing a wide range of food.If you want good food at any time of the day, this is ur place. But if u want great food, I'd recommend looking elsewhere first."
Eli N.,"Columbia, MD",5/3/2017,4.0,"Wow...walked in to this place looking for something quick and it looked like I'd be there forever. Well, let me tell you...I was there a total of about 20 from the time I sat to the time I left. The service was super fast! The place was semi-packed but they got me in and got me out. The food was good but I'd want to go back and try something else. The menu, super extensive. You'll never get through it. Let Yelp pictures or the pictures on their menu guide you to what you want to eat. I ate some crazy stuff in my bento box but it was all good, I tried it all in there. The pricing was cheap for what I got. Oh yeah, When I walked in, I thought I would have a hard time communicating because every single person in there, customers, were all Korean or Japanese and there were a lot of them. Of course the staff was Korean/Japanese and spoke hardly any English. Now that's, authentic. I do feel like if they took a little more time to prep the food it may be better. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I felt it could have been better. Oh yeah, at the end of my meal, they gave me this sweet water drink to wash away the spicy and spices of the food and that was super interesting and cool."
Lauren P.,"Las Vegas, NV",8/23/2017,1.0,"The food was okay, the service was awful. There were a lot of flies buzzing about while we were eating, which was gross but probably can't be helped. My dad and I ordered one bulgogi each. Being used to all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ places, I was disappointed with how small our portion sizes were, especially compared to the high prices. We asked to be seated at a table with a built-in grill but were denied. Instead, they brought a rickety table-top grill out and proceeded to refuse to let us cook out own food. I've been to some restaurants where the waitresses cook your food, and I get that, but our waitress set our meat up on the grill then walked away, which would lead anyone to believe that it's up to you to cook it, right? As soon as I picked up the tongs to check how it was cooking, she rushed back and ripped the tongs out of my hand to cook it herself. It was really awkward. I asked if I could get some dipping sauce for my bulgogi, because every KBBQ place I have ever been to has had sauce on the table, and they didn't seem to understand what I was saying. They wound up giving me some sesame oil, which obviously didn't add much flavor. I just found the service to be really rude. I sat at the table for over 20 minutes without a drink refill. Waitresses would walk by with new full glasses of water for people with half-full glasses already on their tables but wouldn't acknowledge me when I tried to get their attention. We couldn't get our check for over 30 minutes. When we finally got it and put our card in the little booklet, they rushed it to the register and back out immediately and seemed to be trying to push us out the door. We were the only Caucasians in the restaurant, and I don't know if that contributed to how we were treated, but I lived in Asia for over 5 years and was never treated like this before. It was an overwhelmingly awkward and unpleasant dining experience."
Andrei C.,"Burke, VA",8/30/2017,4.0,"This place never disappoints. The food quality is always good. The service is a bit odd, as there are a bunch of women in Korean dress who mill around and attend to your table in some kind of random pattern. The only drawback is that at dinner time you can't park in their tiny lot and the line can be more than 45 minutes. Some of their pricing is a bit high, but if you only go there once in a while, that is not a problem.Sushi is very expensive, about double what you pay in a decent sushi restaurant, but a fair number of the Korean dishes are generally affordable."

You can just see them all standing around and no matter how much you wave they won't notice. Thank goodness for their buzzer or no one would ever come. We had asked several of the staff for more than one side out more sauce and they'd always forget one or the other. Food is overpriced compared to other Korean restaurants in the area. Their BBQ is good but definitely overpriced, can go to so many others for better prices and better meat quality.Their goat soup is delicious! The ground beef bibimbap is alright.However if you are looking for late night eats on Annandale especially if it's after 2 am this is one of the only places that are open 24/7."

Hwal L.,"Roanoke, VA",9/5/2016,3.0,"Any restaurant open 24 hours is expected -by me- to have something special about it that makes it possible for them to be able to afford that distinction. I mean I expected something great, and I got something good, not great. It was Saturday night around 9:30 and the place was packed, and I talked to the person in charge and got us a buzzer. He said 20-25 minutes. We finally got a table and ordered bibimbap and galbi dolsot -hot pot- bibim. Someone dropped us two cups of water, serviettes, and spoons but didn't asked for drink orders, although we weren't planning to. A few minutes later seven side dishes arrived, and of course we immediately dug in. The potato salad was plain and pointless, but the rest were good to great. The eggplant and seaweed were the best! Another few minutes and we got our food, and here's the deal. It's not easy to mess up bibim, but Yechon's wasn't the best. They skimped on veggies for galbi bibim, and although my plain bibim was better, the ingredients were not up to par -it should have had more of everything-. What was good was the busy atmosphere, but frankly, I'm in no rush to go back. Breeze, however, is the bomb!"
Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",2/12/2017,4.0,"I really liked the food here! Super yum and I love the banchan that are given as well! The only reason I bring it down is the service. They were kind of slow. Also, the menu is HUGE and a little overwhelming with some items being way too expensive.So, we get seated and we are served barley tea. It's pretty good and I like all the complimentary items that they give. I decided to get the tofu spicy soup with seafood, and my friends get the salmon teriyaki bento box, and my other friend gets the bulgogi. The soup was fantastic!!! My only problem was, there was no egg!!! I really did like the soup because it had so much flavour and it was spicy! I also liked the tofu and it was really hot and delicious. I just wish it had more seafood. But the seafood that it did have I really liked. It was a good size too and I couldn't finish it. It was worth its price.The salmon teriyaki box was really big!! They had the salad, the big piece of salmon, sushi bite, and tempura. It was a lot and it was definitely worth the cost.The bulgogi was a lot too and it was different. The portion was a lot as well and I liked that. It had a sweet chili taste and I actually really liked it. Here, all the food was really good and I would definitely go back here again."
Tara L.,"Washington, DC",8/3/2016,4.0,"For quick, simple, comfort food, nothing quite hits the spot like Yechon.Since I don't live nearby, it's never really been a late night go-to for me. However, I love grabbing lunch here from time to time and love, love, love to bring Korean BBQ virgins here. There is just so much to explore and enjoy. Of all the meats to feast your eyes and canines on, the Yechon Special Galbi is by far my favorite, sweet and savory treat. (With the bulgolgi, a close runner up.) If you're feeling adventurous and don't feel like going too heavy on the red meats, I'd definitely suggest something from the ""Yechon Specials"" menu. The Yechon Special Menu #1 offers a heaping amount of food for two people, and included a nice spectrum of items: sashimi, dumpling soup, shredded beef ribs, bean pancake, bean paste pot stew, broiled mackerel and mixed rice with dates and ginseng. If you come on the weekends, just come prepared to wait for a bit - it can get pretty popular Friday-Sunday."
Brendan B.,"Davis, CA",8/30/2017,5.0,"This place is amazing, delicious and much classier than you'd expect being that it's Open 24 hrs with neon signs out front.Had the spicy beef bim bim bop and it was flavorful and filling. Enjoy!"
Scott M.,"Vienna, VA",10/21/2016,4.0,"Been to this place many times for dinner, lunch, and Korean BBQ... finally time for a review. The sides for the Korean BBQ are pretty typical and they are all fantastic, if you order two or more items you can have it cooked in front of you.  They cook over a grate that has oil under it which is heated with gas...not charcoal like you'll find in Korea or on my deck in the backyard.The lunch prices for the bento box (container...sts) is a steal and the food is great, lunch runs until 230pm(local).Favorite part was the sugar water drink at the end ;)"
Tabby E.,"Hyattsville, MD",7/21/2017,5.0,"Open 24hr? That could mean alot of things, but it means 1 thing at Yechon; Fresh tasty food no matter what time it is!  Everything was good & will definitely return for more"
Wen F.,"Gainesville, VA",9/26/2016,4.0,"When I'm craving Korean BBQ in the NOVA area and not looking for a buffet, Yechon is my go-to. When it comes to appetizers, I think Yechon has the best seafood pancake I ever eaten... period. If you have any hesitations about appetizers, go for the seafood pancake... you'll love it! I always love all the extra Bonchon that comes with your BBQ as well as the extra lettuce wraps that they give you. I do wish that they have the in-table BBQ vs the hot plates since this is a BBQ place and I just like the overall experience of a built in table BBQ more. The service is generally pretty good as well, they will grill and cut your meat for you while you chow down on apps and side dishes. I do prefer to grill my own meat tho since I love the entire experience of cooking it to the temperature that I like. I always make sure don't cook it all at once (sometimes the staff does this) since it might get cold once they take it off the grill. If you are in the Annandale area and craving Korean BBQ this is the spot to be."
William G.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",6/26/2016,5.0,"As the Saturday was coming to a close, my buddy and I decided to check out a Korean restaurant in the vicinity. After consulting Yelp, I found this place. It was a short 15 minute drive from where we were.Parking was no issue, and neither was the wait to sit down. It was a busy night for them, but they got to us fast. We sipped on water while we decided on what to order. We chose the beef ribs and the spicy chicken. They brought a portable grill to our table and cooked the meat for us. The side dishes added a good complement, as the kimchi and sprouts helped amplify the spicy flavor. After we ate everything, we sipped on some tea (I forget its name). The experience was great, and the meal hit the spot. I would recommend this place."
Veronique L.,"Washington, DC",1/18/2017,3.0,"I'm torn between two and three black stars here. I have definitely experienced better in terms of quantity and quality. For example, the galbi was $30, and there was very little galbi offered. We didn't even have the bbq cooked at the table (which we agreed to only because we weren't seated at a table where there was a bbq). The bulgogi was a big pile of meat, but nothing stood out about it except that I am glad we ordered it otherwise we would have been left starving if we shared the galbi. For $60 (tip included), I felt it was overpriced. I will say that the banchan was varied and surprisingly delicious. They offered some of my favorites, including this potato salad thing, kimchi, mung bean? paste, and lettuce. The women's restroom is clean but only had one sink. It was only a problem because after I finished, the worker who was brushing and flossing would not move so I could wash my hands. As soon as she moved an inch, I washed my hands. She then moved right back to brushing her teeth in front of the mirror. It was awkward. Also, the workers didn't come by to check on us at all. The one guy who cleared off the tables rushed in as soon as we got up, and people only talked to us when they gave us the check. My dining companion never got a refill of the barley tea that was finished about halfway through. We'll most likely not be back especially since there are so many other options in the area."
Vicky L.,"Arlington, VA",8/9/2016,3.0,"The best thing about Yechon is that it's 24/7. There are some things about Yechon that I really enjoyed but other components were meh for a lack of better words that made my entire experience mediocre.We ventured to Yechon late on Friday night and the restaurant was decently packed for 11 PM but there's plenty of seating to go around. Our waiter was fairly unhelpful/unfriendly when we were asking about suggestions of what to order and in general, he seemed like he didn't want to be there. Later in the meal, I saw him arguing with a patron and though I couldn't overhear the context, it definitely should not have escalated to that point. We ended up ordering the Seafood Pancake, Monkfish Stew and Galbi. Banchan/side dishes came out and of all the Korean restaurants I have been to, Yechon has pretty decent ones (+1 for Yechon). The Seafood Pancake came out first and it was pretty massive for 3 (no pictures because we ate half before we remembered) but I definitely recommend ordering it - hits the spot if you're craving it! I can't remember if the Galbi or Monkfish Stew came out next but I didn't really like the Monkfish Stew. It was a little on the watery side in terms of flavor and I wish we hadn't ordered it. The seafood in the stew in general didn't seem fresh and was super fish-y smelling - in general, not very appetizing. The Galbi came out sizzling hot on a stone plate so I do recommend ordering that.Overall, not bad but leaning more on the unsatisfactory side of things. If Yechon wasn't next to Breeze Bakery, I probably wouldn't stop by as frequently but maybe just stick with what you know is good."
Hanna K.,"Annandale, VA",8/10/2017,4.0,Open 24/7 and they also expanded their lot so you no longer have to struggle to find parking. Their food is also very good!
Min K.,"Arlington, VA",1/1/2017,5.0,"One of my favorite all-around Korean restaurant faves. Great service, good banchan, great food at reasonable prices, and 24/7 hours. If you're looking to please a group of friends with different taste and food preferences this is the place to go for Korean. They offer Korean BBQ, sushi, staple Korean dishes like bibimbap, soon dooboo jigae, and kalbi tang.I've been going here for years and this is still going strong. It's always packed in here and for good reason! Only vice is you can't make reservations here so it's first come first serve. Usually on the weekend during lunch and dinner there will be a wait."
Kristen I.,"Washington, DC",1/9/2017,4.0,"Whew, was here Saturday night/Sunday morning for ""sober up"" food! I can't say I remember every detail, but the spicy seafood casserole and galbi definitely helped soothe my tummy the next morning. :)"
Brett N.,"Tampa, FL",12/1/2016,5.0,"Why 5 stars? Because it's hard to be anything else when it comes to Korean BBQ!   ---   ---   ---Full disclosure: I don't think I've ever given a Korean BBQ less than 5-stars. Just being in the presence of KBBQ makes me so happy - nothing can go wrong when I'm there. This is my Disney World.Not only was I partaking in my favorite thing, but I was with some mighty-awesome folks who live in the area. They were able to pick out the good stuff on the menu, which allowed me to simply sit there and shove food down my gullet without thinking. This is my favorite kind of dinner - the kind where I don't burn one calorie of brain power, and take-in several thousands.I always crack up watching the servers cut meat with scissors. Why does this amuse me so much? I don't know. I've never done it myself, but you'd think I'd be used to it by now, after enough Korean BBQ experiences under my belt. Nope. Then again, I don't get out much.All of the food was perfect as usual. If I have one critique, it's definitely a divey place. Expect chairs with rips in the cushions and tables that could only be described as 'dingy.' But if you're willing to look past that, then this is the place to get your fix!"
Ted C.,Hong Kong,8/20/2016,4.0,"Yechon is a pretty decent place for Korean and according to some people I know a mainstay in the DMV for Korean (they apparently did not card for soju back in the day.) I've been here three times now with people who've had varied exposure to Korean food: complete newbies, to a mix and those that might as well have gochujang and kimchee in their veins and none of these groups have ever said a bad thing about it here.If you're going to be in a big group, consider the special menu, even though it's a set they can tweak it a little to suit your tastes-well we did end up getting two different kinds but swapped out meats for dietary restrictions and it turned out fine, and you get some crappy Asian lager-not an insult it's just most Asian lagers are pretty bad, BUT it does go great with Korean bbq at your table.For non-BBQ stuff, the haemul paejon isn't bad, a pretty big portion and enough to share as an appetizer-although to be honest, appetizers here and Korean restaurants in general don't really come out before the main entrees. I usually like getting cold Korean noodles in the summer and it's okay here.The service can be a little hectic, don't be afraid to flag down any staff member and your request will be met pretty quickly, even during busy times."
Paul S.,"Columbia, MD",5/30/2017,4.0,"I can see why this place is so crowded and popular. With a huge menu, there's something for everyone, but we ended up mostly KBBQ. We had bulgogi, pork belly, brisket, and galbi and all were very good. Good quality of meat although they cook the bulgogi and galbi in the kitchen and not tableside. The sushi appetizer and seafood pancake were really done well too. They give you a lot of panchan, although no steamed egg. Service was excellent and oh, they don't like it when you try to turn the meat haha"
Michael L.,"Washington, DC",6/1/2016,4.0,"THE BIG: Yes-Chon! I thought for a second this place was a korean temple from the outside. Spacious interior with plenty of parking outside. Open 24/7 and located on the corner of Hummer Rd and Little River Turnpike and conveniently placed right next to the 7-eleven. #hollaTHE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here for lunch on a Sunday. It was pretty crowded but we luckily got seated quickly (probably because it was only two of us). The decor inside was very traditional korean with wooden tables, chairs, and bar.As for food, we got the Bibimbap and the Japchae. The servers were very pushy on getting orders out and fast. I'm a slow chooser and eater, so having the added pressure didn't help the ambience of the place. With that being said, the food did come out fast, so they're efficient at cycling people in and out. The Bibimbap was served in a fancy bowl with the gokujon and rice separate. The bowl had good size chunks of beef, bean sprouts, pickled carrots, zucchini. I find it so satisfying mixing everything together (rice + veggies + gokujon). The flavors are mouth watering. The japchae is lightly flavored glass noodles that is always a solid filler choice. Don't forget about the crazy amount of banchan delivered when you order your food. THE FINAL BAMBOO: Spent around $30 without tip ($36 w/ tip) at lunchtime. I guess the two items we ate was on the more expensive side. They do have lunch specials but I would highly recommend the bibimbap."
Mary H.,"Falls Church, VA",5/7/2017,4.0,"What's not to love about a 24 hour Korean spot with parking! Food quality is always good. Service is consistent. It may not be necessarily friendly, but they get the job done. I get my usual soft tofu soup and the usual Korean BBQ, galbi, bulgogi, and now their brisket, yum! Prices are comparable to the area... they do well with large groups and have been accommodating with my food allergies. I for one... do not like to cook my own food, yay for me!  I like having that option."
Helena K.,"Fairfax, VA",8/20/2017,1.0,Service is suck. We have to call them 3 times just to bring us menu. They mess up our order. They didn't even bring out one of our order and all they did was saying sorry. Didn't even explain or make up for us. Food taste bad. I would not recommend it for anyone. This is my 3rd time and I still don't like it. Nothing change at all
Oliver A.,"Washington, DC",1/17/2017,5.0,"Yechon is my favorite Korean restaurant. The food taste fresh and delicious, the service is great and even though they get extremely busy they are very orderly. Caution, everyone knows they are good so this place is packed Friday thru Sunday.  Breeze next door is also popular so parking on the weekends at dinner is a nightmare."

Updated review",2.0,"Worms in the cod fish soup! After a long morning of medical treatments, my husband and I went to Yechon for a late lunch. We both ordered the codfish soup, non-spicy version with no tofu. A few spoonfuls into the soup, my husband pulled out something that looked odd - which turned out to be a little worm! It was pale and about 2 inches in length but it was unmistakable. We called the server over to let her know. As soon as she went to inform the manager, during which time my husband trepidatiously stirred his soup - and found a second worm with its head buried in the flesh of a piece of the cod, whilst its body and tail were out.Although I didn't see any worms in my soup, I refused to eat it - because it had come from the same batch. We were only refunded for my husband's soup.Later I checked on line and learned that cod sometimes have cod worms - but these are supposed to be cleaned off before consumption, and the restaurant had not decided be so. I am attaching pictures and you will see one of them where the head is still wedged in. In case there is any doubt, believe me - no pieces of mung stalk or vegetables bury their heads in the flesh of a fish like this."
Amanda M.,"Washington, DC",1/15/2017,5.0,"I've been coming to Yechon for about 20 years and it is my favorite Korean restaurant hands down.  When people think of Korean food, they immediately think of Korean BBQ.  Perks of eating here rather than a BBQ place:Variety of banchanAll Korean dishes including soups and stews, casseroles, and specialty dishesSushiBBQJapanese dishesTotally different menu for breakfastLunch specials including bento boxesI love that it's open 24/7 since there aren't many restaurants that are.  We came on a Friday night at 10pm and it was packed!  Thrillist mentioned it as ""close to your Korean grandmother's cooking"" and I agree, it's as authentic as it gets."
Lilian H.,"Alexandria, VA",8/18/2017,4.0,Grate place for Korean bbq. Busy so expect to wait or just show up in late night hours since they are always open.
Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",4/18/2016,3.0,"Yechon is the place to go if you're craving meats at 3 in the morning. Open 24 hours 7 days a week, Yechon serves both Korean and Japanese cuisine to a diverse crowd. It seems that no matter what the hour, it always seems to be bustling.Thankfully, their parking lot expanded because this is one of the smallest lots in Annandale. Parking used to be such a pain, as people desperately fought for precious spaces. It doesn't help that Breeze Bakery is next door and is also open quite late, catering to folks who like to gather and/or study for hours. They've expanded a little bit more, so now there's more parking available but I still think it can be a struggle. Whenever I go to Yechon, I usually get their Korean BBQ. KBBQ can wildly vary here, from being ehh to being pretty good. I think it depends on what kind of grill you're getting the meats cooked on. The restaurant has both built-in grills and the portable stoves, and I think that food cooked on the portable stoves lead to inferior taste. My favorite meats are samgyeopsal (thinly sliced pork belly) and chadolbaegi (brisket beef). Banchan is provided too. I think as I'm getting older and metabolism dwindles to nothingness, I'm appreciating restaurants like Yechon more where it's no AYCE option. In the past, it seemed ridiculous to even consider going to Yechon when places like Kogiya served tastier, higher quality meats at an AYCE option and for significantly less money. However, provided that their meat quality is actually decent (again, seems to vary depending on when you go), I think Yechon is an ideal choice for those who can't devour AYCE like before. Service seems pretty consistent. The servers (all women) dress up in traditional Korean garb and for the most part, they are friendly and efficient. While I don't prefer Yechon, it is a suitable alternative to some of the other Korean BBQ joints in town. And definitely one of the only options open late at night."
Genesis D.,"Washington, DC",4/15/2017,5.0,"This place is 24 hours and they have a huge menu. Granted they aren't an AYCE KBBQ place, there's still so much to like here. Everyone I've taken here has not been disappointed. It's not like super fancy nor hole-in-the-wall type. I can't believe how busy it gets here but hey, people know what's good. Errr actually I haven't tried their Japanese food options but I will one day since I go here so often and if my feelings change about them then I'll update my review. But that might not happen because they are open 24 hours, they are right next to Breeze which I love, they are more traditional and the waitresses are very quick and polite, and the bibimbap is always a good go to if I'm not feeling to try something new."

Updated review",4.0,Still good services. Food was not as good as last time (ordered sushi covered rice and kimchi dolsot bibimpap) but still pretty decent compared to other korean restaurants. Food was around $13-15 each meal. I would recommend getting jeon gol (big soup for multiple people cuz it's bomb!)
Qing S.,"College Park, MD",8/8/2017,1.0,We ordered the special Galbi barbecue and we end up with only a handful thin pieces of beef on the plate. We definitely will not recommend our friends and families to come again.
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",4/9/2017,4.0,"My hubby and I visited Yechon last July and enjoyed the food a lot.  The restaurant is one of many great Korean restaurants in the Annandale, VA area.  It can get PACKED. We visited for an early dinner on a Saturday, so it wasn't too bad and we were able to get seated fairly quickly.  We ordered the Korean BBQ with beef bulgogi and beef galbi.  Our meal came with the customary sides (banchan), including kimchi, pickled cucumbers, seaweed, large tofu, potato salad, chili paste, rice, and bok choy.  It also came with a delicious soup and lettuce, which paired perfectly with the meat.  I am obsessed with Korean BBQ and crave it often, so this was great.  My only complaint (as is my complaint regarding some other Korean restaurants in the Annandale, VA area) is that they did not let us cook our own food.  I usually love BBQ-ing my own meats at Korean BBQ restaurants, but the ones in Virginia somehow don't let their customers do that.  What's the point of having a BBQ grill in front of you if you can't cook your food yourself on it?  They might as well cook the food themselves and then bring it out.  Other than that, Yechon was amazing and I would love to visit again.  Great food and great atmosphere."
Diana P.,"New York, NY",5/4/2017,4.0,"They had a great selection of banchan here! I'm very glad this one of those places that does not skimp on the ban chan and gave us a great variety :) We ordered the galbi bbq, galbi bibimbap, and seafood pancake for two. It was definitely a lot of food and we had leftovers, but everything was great! The seafood pancake was gigantic and pretty thick with a good amount of seafood in it. The only thing I did not like about this place was that they only let you cook it on the grill if you order TWO meats. :( We were only a party of two so we felt that one selection was enough. You're still able to do this but they will cook it in the back for you which kinda defeats the purpose of kbbq. They were very efficient and prompt with the food and the service was quick!"
Zhen W.,"McLean, VA",7/9/2017,1.0,"Waittress told us to ""get out"" in broken english not even 10 minutes after we finished our food. Absolutely awful service and attitude. This place tends to treat korean customers better. Would not recommend."
Ser W.,"Silver Spring, MD",8/11/2017,3.0,"I wrote this in my review for Breeze Bakery; the parking is atrocious during rush hour/in the evening. Absolutely hate it, so prepare thyself.I've been to Yechon a couple of times now and they're okay. There are a lot of choices on the menu, but have to be careful during the evening. There is a certain time when some of the food choices are unavailable.The tonkatsu plate is decent sized. It's your typical fried pork cutlet so can't go wrong with that. It was my first time seeing fuji apple being served with it on the plate; which was very interesting. It went well together!The boyangtang (goat meat soap) is good also. I personally don't like goat because it's too gamy, but I do recognize it was cooked well.The beef yakisoba was very basic. Very. Basic. I, personally, was not a fan (and I ordered it because everything else I wanted was unavailable).Like I mentioned, there are lots of choices."
Nay W.,"Chesapeake, VA",3/27/2017,5.0,Omg! We waited for 30min and inside restaurant was full but It was worth! Their Korean waitress works so hard and after we ordered they brought so many side dished. We ordered some bulkogi. We can choose from cooks from kitchen or grill own on the table. The taste is better than I ate in Korea and a lot of Korean were eating in there so I knew it is really taste good. Their price is not bad and better customer service than other Korean restaurant in DC area. If I have a chance to go to D.C.  Again.i definitely visit to them and try their Yukjaryang.
Ellim C.,"Springfield, VA",8/3/2017,4.0,Had some friends visiting and took them here for a late night meal. I come here all the time with friends after a late night of volleyball or Frisbee! We ordered several orders of their beef brisket and pork belly as well. Always consistently crispy and delicious. I love coming here all the time! Their beef and octopus noodle soup is probably the best in the area too!
Sonnya B.,"Elkridge, MD",9/13/2016,3.0,"My friends really like this place. You get a ton of food for the price. Especially @ lunch. I'm not so sold on it. Service sucks. They're brusque & dismissive & they toss your tray/ food @ you. I guess that's diner-style service & in line with their whole 24-HR thing? I don't know. This whole experience kinda sucks. Parking lot is always packed, there is no proper like/ sign-in @ the door. You never know when a server will come get your order etc... I'd rather eat next door @ the bakery. Service is fabulous. The food & presentation are great. They also serve all the Korean staples. If you want more exotic / authentic dishes, come to Yechon."
Steve H.,"Burke, VA",1/20/2017,5.0,This place is a legend. The food is always great here. Been in business for a while now. After eating here i stop by breeze bakery next door for desert.I normally get the kalbi or bulgogi.
Caley S.,"Reston, VA",1/14/2017,4.0,"This was my first Korean BBQ experience and it was really fun to watch dinner cooking right there at your table!My friend ordered for us so to be honest I'm not totally sure what everything on the table was, but it was all delicious. My only complaint would be that the pork belly left a little to be desired - not as flavorful and rich as you expect pork belly to be. Also, you can apparently only order meat in certain combinations off the menu; the two we wanted originally the waitress informed us can't be ordered together.But overall the food was good, I loved having it freshly cooked (although sitting and watching the first round cook while you're starving is tough!) and it was pretty inexpensive for the amount of food we got!"
Eddie K.,"Rockville, MD",2/13/2016,4.0,"I fondly remember my drinking days when I used to frequent Yechon around 3-4 AM almost every weekend.  Alas, those days are long gone.   That was so much fun eating and talking with all the late night party people. But now I come here with my family.  This place is always crowded and for good reason.  I think their bulgogi is really good.  My go to dishes are dol sot bimbimbap, maeun galbi tang and Yukgaejang.So happy they tripled the amount of parking spaces now, so I won't have to get stressed out finding a spot."
Joe N.,"Annandale, VA",7/30/2017,3.0,"An Annandale institution. You always know that Yechon will be there for you at 4am after your drunken revelries in DC.

Charolastra M.,"Burke, VA",7/22/2017,4.0,"I'm awarding 4/5 stars because the food is 'only' great, not 'exemplary'.I live 1 mile away from Yechon.  My Korean wife and I have eaten here 20+ times together - with her probably eating there an additional 500 times!  Yechon is an Annandale staple in competent, tasty Korean cuisine.  It definitely helps if you speak Korean, as that will help with the service.  Overall:Food: 4/5.  Very extensive menu, with tons of Korean classics, and a few Japanese ones as well.  I have probably eaten 80% of the menu, and have yet to ever be disappointed.  Service: 5/5.  I am biased, but my korean wife keeps the wait staff there LOCKED DOWN in ensuring we have excellent service.  We have a 2.5 year old, and they are very attentive in ensuring our child gets a sippy cup, plastic utensils, etc., to ensure for a good dining out with children experience.  There are buttons on each table to call for the non-dedicated wait staff, which helps if you have trouble getting the attention of a server.  Ambiance: 4/5.  A bit noisy, but in a ""fun hotspot"" kind of way.  Not a good romantic date spot.  With that said, they are open 24/7.  This is HUGE.  Price: 5/5.  If you order the specials at lunchtime pricing, food will be very cheap, compared to what you get for the money.  Normal dinner entrees are priced competitively* (*~$25 range), but they come with tons of ban chan - Korean side dishes - which are unlimited.  You will not leave here hungry unless you don't like Korean food!Overall: I love this place.  My Korean wife loves this place.  Our kid loves this place.  Any non-Koreans love this place.  Any Koreans visiting from Korea love this place.   It is the real deal."

Stacey H.,"Burke, VA",6/17/2017,2.0,"I have been coming to Yechon for about 5-6 years, and I should have taken the time to write a review before now - so that my experiences could be substantiated.  What was once a 5 star for me...has now declined to a less than average dining experience.  PROS:  24/7 service, which is fun and convenient and quirky.  Great food.  Parking has vastly improved with the addition of an adjacent lot.  Many varied banchan keep the auxiliary tastes and textures alive and poppingCONS:  Terrible service, on so many levelsMy husband and I ate there last night, and were seated about 7:30, the wait was not too long - considering it was a Friday evening.  We ordered pan-fried dumplings, scallion/hot pepper pancake and traditional bulgogi.  The waitress (Server A) carefully repeated back the order.  Another server, I will call her Server B,  (there are many, and they seem to pitch in and assist each other) brought banchan and water.  I did want hot tea, but was not asked - which was different from my other experiences in this restaurant...but not a deal breaker.  The food delivery was delayed, and that was ok - due to the busy atmosphere.  The pancake came out first, and the Server C placed a wedge on my plate...it was a seafood pancake.  This was not the server that took my order, and I politely said, ""We ordered scallion...not seafood"".  The server took a few seconds to realize, but then took the tongs and the wedge on my plate, and put it back on the large platter with the rest of the pancake and said ""OK, I will check"".  I handed her back my plate, as I wanted another one.  Server C left the table with my plate and the seafood pancake.  A few minutes later, Server B comes back and brings the bugogi and a serving of rice.  I asked for another plate, as my initial plate was taken away during the seafood pancake melee, and she says to me ""Only one plate here?"" I did not answer because, yes - she was correct...there was only one plate - and had the pancake error not occurred, we would have had our precise and allotted amount.  So, she does bring back another plate for me, and I mention ""we ordered dumplings..."", so she says they will be coming soon.  Server C comes back with the correct pancake, and shortly after, server B brings the dumplings.  Now we have our correct order, and are enjoying the meal.  Again, the food is delicious.  However, we were not offered more water other than our initially poured 2 glasses, nor were we asked if we needed more banchan.  The answer would have been yes to both.  Especially, water...many times over.  The next time a server comes to the table, it is because we were obviously finished eating, and were ready for the check.  We had a good deal of food left over, and asked for take away boxes.  Server C comes back with boxes for the pancake/dumplings, and a small box for the bulgogi.  I ask about the rice and the lettuce leaves, and was told ""only rice"".  Huh?  these lettuce leaves have been sitting on the table with my meal...I'm thinking that they certainly cannot be re-used for another customer...?Suggestions that I would make for a much better service experience:1.  Offer tea to your customers.  (yes, it is extra $...but offer)2.  If a food error is made, apologize.  It is so simple and goes so far to hear, ""I'm sorry, let me correct that for you"".  It is ok to make a mistake, but please be accountable and apologize for my experience.  3.  Please don't make customers feel bad about asking for another clean plate.  In my case last night, I asked due to a service error - not because I wanted to be indulgent.  4.  Ask your customers if water refills are needed.  Often.  This restaurant has SO MANY bus staff whose job is to clear tables and pour water/tea.  Korean food is salty and can be spicy...many people enjoy their water glasses filled.  5.  Be mindful of the banchan, and when it needs refills.  Ask the customer if they would like more.6.  Please do not rush your customers.  I would have gladly waited an extra 15-20 minutes on the front end if I knew that my meal would not seem rushed, due to you hustling another party along.  Not seeing any server from the time the meal is delivered until the check is presented made me feel very rushed.  7.  Takeaway - leftovers...please allow the customer to take home what is on the table, rice, banchan and lettuce wraps included.  They are paid for and part of the ordered meal.  Also, it is a health code violation to reuse them. Oh, it's extra work and cumbersome to pack up?  brb, I am going to get a violin to play a sad song...I really, really hope that there is a senior marketing or leadership person that reads reviews and decides to implement some change...I want to keep recommending this restaurant to others, and coming back myself...but with so many service errors and lack of customer service - it is becoming a very tough sell."
Matthew H.,"Washington, DC",2/20/2017,3.0,"It's not the best Korean restaurant, but the service was great. The pancake was huge, and my bulgogi was decent. I wouldn't come back here, however, as there are better places in the area."
Lotus S.,"Arlington, VA",3/3/2017,4.0,It took a little before we were served. The sushi was great and the Japanese and Korean BBQ was delicious as well. The beef rib soup was OK except the ribs had no flavor. We drank the tea that helped balance all the flavors.

Updated review",3.0,Lunch deals are hard to beat. Tempura lunch box for less than $10 is really a deal. 3 pcs of huge shrimps and a lot of other things on the bento box. Service is not the best.
Lorraine T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",6/9/2017,5.0,"Went there with my friends a few times. Not too crowded because it was late night 2am or something. Service is good, food is amazing!!!! Definitely will recommend that to ppl."
Lilly N.,"Falls Church, VA",2/10/2016,4.0,"Today we had the chirash and the galbi dolsot bibimbap for lunch. The chirash is about $19 and the bibimbap was on the lunch special for about $10. I felt like the chirashi was over priced though the sashimi was good. The bibimbap was good though. I love it with its in the hot stone bowl and makes the rice crispy a the bottom. The meal always comes with the miso soup and side dishes, which were good. I like my kimchi fermented longer, but that's based on everyone's own preference. The staff greeted but I did feel like they forgot about our table after we said we needed some time to look at the menu. But overall it's a good place to eat for lunch"
Bryan S.,"North Bethesda, MD",9/5/2016,4.0,"If you have a korean food craving at any part of the day or night, this 24-hour restaurant is for you.  They have a big menu with a variety of selections.  Can't say they have any signature  dishes but I've never had anything that tasted really bad and I've been going here for over 10 years.  There's a lot of new restaurants that popped up over the years where some dishes are better but not too many are open all day and night.  Their traditional theme is fine but putting in a bit of a modern touch to the place can't hurt."
Sinai L.,"Glen Burnie, MD",4/24/2017,3.0,Ordered cod fish tofu pot....was average and cod fish was frozen and you can taste it....a bit disappointed since the restaurant seems to have a great rating...
Joseph Y.,"Rockville, MD",3/26/2017,4.0,"This is my go to spot for Korean.  They are reasonably priced.  Have a good menu with wide array of options.  The food is consistently good...but not great.  A big advantage is the 24/7 service...but the service itself is a bit uneven.I wish the on table grill service was run better, but if you want grill only...there are other options right down the street.I miss Han Sung Oak, but for now this is my place for the full menu I want to order"
V L.,"Fairfax, VA",4/6/2017,2.0,"This used to be our family go to restaurant, but this place has really changed. The food isn't as good and the prices have really gone up. The customer service isn't as good either. They don't seem to really care about their patrons."
Dylan Keith W.,"Honolulu, HI",12/16/2015,5.0,"Everyone knows how critical I am of Korean joints around DMV. But at last! We have found the winner! And frankly, this is probably some of the best Korean restaurant food I've ever had stateside.Prices were reasonable given that the portions were huge, and everything tasted fantastic. We tried a variety of things; pajeon, japchae, bulgogi, mandu, bibimbap, etc. And all of it was great. And the banchan was all really fresh and well-made as well. I'm not really sure what else to say because you're either familiar with Korean food or you're not, but if you are, this place is the way to go. I like that this place is 24 hours. Makes me feel just like being back in Seoul, pigging out on food in the middle of the night after a long night out. The only bummer is they don't serve any Chilsung Cider.The service was good too, and my waitress even gave me a free calendar for the holidays. I thought that was a nice gesture.So overall, this is the place I would recommend without hesitation for getting great Korean food. Easily 5/5!"
june k.,"Durham, NC",12/25/2015,4.0,I was amazed by how quickly the waitstaff move! We were in an out of there in 30 min. The galbi tang and yookeh Jjang had the same broth. There was a lot of beef in both soups!
Victoria N.,"Chantilly, VA",7/18/2016,3.0,I'd say Yechon deserves a 3.5 star rating. A simple list of pros and cons should help:Pros: Lots of the little side dishesFood was decently tastyCons: Waitresses could not hear/understand your requests and we couldn't understand them (language barrier) and some were downright rude It's really cramped and therefore loudPaid 70$ for the Yechon #3 special with lobster and there seemed to not have much meat to go around for 4 people Tofu soup came out super salty so we had to return it and have a new batch made PricyGlad I tried it but I'll move on to looking at some other places.
Sophany S.,"Alexandria, VA",2/19/2017,4.0,"Honestly, I've really only come here late at night since it's open 24 hours. But the food is good and they offer fresh sushi as well. They have a sashimi rice bowl that comes with veggies and a red chilli sauce that is delicious! I've only ever really ordered the basics here - bulgogi, kalbi and kimchi chigae. All good, though nothing special. The service is eh. I feel you get better service when you're Korean and speak the language, but that's kind of expected at most of the Korean restaurants in Annandale."
Alice L.,"Van Ness/Forest Hills, Washington, DC",2/3/2017,5.0,"Wow.... WOW... WOWWW.... been going to yeachon for yearrrssssssss. This is the first time I've received such outstanding service from Lee. He was helpful, charming, and responsive. He forgot his pen on his way to our table but he remembered our long and annoying order of no vegetable and specific side dishes. The food was also on point tonight. Go yeachon!!!! I will be back... just to see Lee"
Elizabeth F.,"Loudoun County, VA",3/30/2017,5.0,"Went here for lunch and it was delicious.  Ordered the bugolgi beef box.  Was presented with some hot tea, an array of Koren appetizers, the lunch box, and a sweet rice drink for dessert.  So much food for $9.95...an amazing lunch special.  The place was pretty busy - definitely a hot spot for lunch, but also kind of a hidden gem.  I would recommend this to anyone going to Annandale for a meal. I will be back!"
Nhon T.,"Springfield, VA",3/15/2017,4.0,"This place is always on the list to go after a night out or a late night at work. Interesting type of crowd you see depending on the hours you go at night. I went with a few new friends and enjoyed some quality time with their eel. I believe my friends ordered bibimbap and a vegetarian yakisoba. The eel was delicious and everything that I expected. I was looking at my friends bibimbap and wondering why it wasn't served in a clay pot, unless they got like a cold type dish? Other than that it'll always be a name to bring up late at night for me."
Lauren C.,"Lynchburg, VA",7/3/2016,4.0,"It looks like a traditional old Korean house, very Asian, you can't miss it! Service is great, very friendly and always crowded during lunch time. The foods great, but I feel like I could make this at home so that's why I give it 4 star. Nothing exciting in my opinion. Right next to them is Breeze Cafe, so if you want bingsoo or other baked Korean goods, go there!"
Nina Y.,"Waldorf, MD",3/26/2017,4.0,"My boyfriend and I are regulars here. They know us and they know what we like. We drive from Southern MD to come here for dinner because it's open 24/7 and it's OKAY Korean food for the price. TBH I'd much rather give this rating 3 stars, but I'll give it 4 because of how often we frequent this site despite their off and on again customer service. There was a night when one of the waitresses decided to speak about us in Korean to another waitress (probably assuming I couldn't understand). I thought it was rude and decided to speak back because I wasn't going to let that go. The conversation wasn't anything crazy, she was just telling one of her co-workers ""this couple doesn't eat all of their side dishes so don't give everything to them."" Honestly, we're paying for the food and we thank them in greater-than-standard gratuity (even when the service isn't up to par) so withdrawing certain dishes to us just because we can't finish it, makes no sense to me at all. Another thing that bothers me, that I'm sure others have witnessed, is feeling rushed. I do not like to be rushed at all. Please do not rush me to finish eating and definitely do not rush me when we pull out our wallets. Nothing ruins a good meal more than when a waitress is standing hip to hip, right next to you, waiting for the bill and tip. Please .....let us finish eating.Anyways, since I've forewarned you guys about the service here...some of the dishes that I'd recommend are: chirashi sushi bowl (they don't make this after 10 pm), dolsot bibimbap, and the doenjang jigae.If you're trying to come here for KBBQ, go to an actual AYCE KBBQ restaurant instead."
Rob B.,"Fairfax, VA",7/1/2017,1.0,"I'm not returning again. There needs to be an overnight manager to address issues, because I had to passive-aggressively threaten to call the health department over a bug found in my side dish before they agreed to cancel my bill."
JW P.,"Fairfax, VA",8/5/2016,3.0,"TL;DR - A standard Korean restaurant with a menu that tries to include everything but only seems to shine in a few dishes.  Nothing is bad, everything is at least average for this area.Food: As of August 2016, I've checked into Yechon 17 times but it seems like more.  My favorite dishes here have been the galbi-tang and the galbi dol-sot bibimbap.  I do notice a lack of consistency though.  The last time I came, my galbitang was undercooked as the slices of radish and onion were not as soft as they should be.  A bit unappetizing to get that ""bite"".Service: Lacking sufficient attention as my waters and side dishes were empty for a while, but you can just hail down the waitstaff with the buzzers on your table.Another note on consistency...everything is worse when you dine at 4 in the morning.  But that's what's great about Yechon...Korean food 24/7!"
Matthew N.,"Santa Maria, CA",6/26/2017,2.0,"Everything was going so well and I was ready to rate this place 4 stars. I am from Southern California and I've had my fair share of Korean food in the awesome Korea town of Los Angeles. The service was friendly and quick. The ladies cooked for our table of 2. The food was pricey, but it was solid. I enjoyed the meal from the side dishes to the quality of the short ribs and prime rib. The seasoning wasn't perfect, but still good enough. All seemed well until the moment they finished clearing our table 2 minutes after we signed our check as we were full and discussing what our plan was after dinner. The lady who took our check immediately changed our experience. In an annoyed and condescending tone, she stated to us, ""there are people waiting."" In addition, the lady utilized her body language to signal for us to leave. I am not one to be inconsiderate and sit at a table while there are people waiting to be seated, nor did we take long. It was literally 2 minutes after we signed the check. This was the first time in my life that I was basically kicked out of a restaurant. Oh well! We were caught off guard and didn't know what to say so we just left without questioning or thinking about it. We saw 2 small groups waiting to be seated. Hahahah, that's awesome. Thank you for your hospitality Yechon!"
Sam M.,"Springfield, VA",7/4/2017,5.0,"Favorite place to eat whether it's 2 pm or 4 am! Wish they'd make sushi past 10 pm, but the food and service is amazing and fast."
Dale J.,"Capitol Heights, MD",6/9/2016,4.0,"Out for lunch with a diverse group of employees on our Asian Cultural Culinary discovery we ventured to the YECHON. Located in Annandale VA. which is a seriously Korean/Asian area. So in our group was 1 African American (me) 2 from China, 1 Korean, 3 Caucasians, 1 Pakistani, 1 Malaysian and 1 guy who said he was mixed. So we were really trying to get our War Veteran to try more than General Tso chicken...that's all he wanted and requested. But no sir...this place is the real deal and General Tso is American made Chinese food. . When you walk in your going to see mostly locals of Asian decent and thats a great sign that your at a real deal Asian Restaurant. They specialize in Korean and Japanese Cuisine. I really liked that they were able to accommodate a group of 10 to which we tried to get a reservation but they stated no need. We did wait 20 minutes to get seated however. The FOOD:OK....our Korean representative set us up with this visit. It was all good the waiters dressed in formal Korean attire was a nice touch. We ordered the Korean BBQ Bulgogi and the shrimp pancakes as appetizers for all. I think the Bulgogi was good but it tasted like some steak and cheese without the bread..Not really impressed or depressed about it 3stars The shrimp pancakes were a hit...we ordered two and they are the size of a large pizza needless to say we had leftovers of that. But very crisp on the outside warm and tasty inside where the shrimp and scallops could be had with scallions and other tasty goodness inside 4.5 stars.....I ordered the spicy chicken box which was very very good. It came with 1 chicken wing...Im like I know Im black and all but i dont need a chicken wing today I wanted the spicy chicken box....then I looked at a few others and they ordered a box type thing and theirs came with a chicken wing too. HMM....either way...that one lonely sucka was tasty...So what I love wings....LOL...It also came with 1 piece of a California roll, miso soup, salad, fried octopus, and plenty other things. It was very good. Our group had a diverse mix of foods from stews, soups, lunch boxes and appetizers. All and all its a great family place to eat and a super wide selection of Korean and Japanese foods."
Anna A.,"Reston, VA",8/1/2016,3.0,It's pretty ok. Even though they say quality of meat here is better than honey pig they are missing the garlic sauce...Service is like any other Korean BBQ place which is meh. They do have those ringers on the table which are fun to press and see people running towards you haha.I guess it's between 3 and 4 stars.Prices are steep for what you get.Parking is very hard to find during busy hours. Might also need a reservation.
John C.,"Centreville, VA",4/30/2017,1.0,"I have been to this restaurant for 10 plus years.I knew that I wouldn't be able to finish my soup, so before I started eating I asked the staff for a to-go container and they brought me a small styrofoam container(around 20 oz), yet I wanted the tall plastic container(32 oz). I asked continuously for three times, but they brought the cheap styrofoam container until lastly they brought me a tall plastic container(32 oz). I gave the styrofoam container to the assistant manager and I asked him to bring me the plastic container And he gave me a nasty glare and expected me to use the Styrofoam container. He went to the back and never returned. So I called one more time and the waitress brought me the same cheap styrofoam container. Then I asked one last time and the waitress brought the tall plastic container(32 oz), and she said ""This container is very expensive."" We were not done eating and the waitress came to our table and said herself to hurry up and leave .We spent almost $200.00 for our dinner and they say that the small to-go containers are expensive when the meal prices are not even cheap. The servers were pushing us to leave.In the past years, the service was never this bad. I am very disappointed at this establishment."

Jessica S.,"Annandale, VA",1/26/2017,1.0,"I used to be a regular at this place but over the passed 15 years, their quality in food and service has plummeted downhill. Or maybe its just lunch time. We went for lunch special around 1pm today and got the donkatsu & salmon lunch boxes along with a kimchi soup. The miso soup that normally comes with the bentoboxes were both served cold. The lunchboxes tasted stale and old -disgusting. The Wasabi on both of the lunch boxes were dried and crusty....not appetizing at all(look at pictures I posted). I had to push the bell on the table multiple times for someone to bring us boxes...and I thought this was ridiculous considering the restaurant wasn't even half full. Upon asking for some boxes I asked for one more and my waitress replied with ""it will all fit in two boxes"", and she walked away. I ended up having to push the button one more time to get my extra box because my food didn't fit in the two boxes given. I don't understand what the big deal was in giving me one extra to go box."
Ron R.,"Alexandria, VA",6/17/2017,3.0,"The quality seems to have gone downhill. For the prices you'd expect food to be cooked right everytime you come. We went 2 days in a row and the first night the rice was way mushy; the 2nd night the noodles were undercooked. Honestly, that's pretty bad considering rice and noodles are the staple of the meal. It's like getting your pizza and the dough is mushy, or your pasta is undercooked. I like the food here, but that's a real deal breaker when there are so many good Korean restaurants in the area. I'll update my review again if things change as I really do like the food here."
Heather B.,"Wailuku, HI",7/23/2016,3.0,"24 hour korean bbq. We used to frequent this spot a lot more. Not so much now. Service isn't that great but at least the food is consistent. There are many options for korean bbq in Annandale but this place has been around forever. I'm pretty sure this was my first taste of korean bbq. They have a sushi bar but it closes around 10. They also have pretty decent lunch specials in the form of bento boxes. I think yechon tends to be on the pricier side of the korean bbq spectrum. If you can disregard thier often spotty service issues then come here. At least you know you can count on some good korean food. Also check out thier combo meals. They tend to be a great value if you have 4 to 6 people. It can be a lot of food. We normally get the one with bbq chicken, pork, 2 different beef options and lobster. You also get a soup. So much food and you kind of get to try a little bit of everything."
Carol J.,"Alexandria, VA",7/23/2016,3.0,"I love this place and consider it very authentic Korean food, to the point where I always bring out of town guests here if they're craving Korean.  However this past weekend I brought my parents who are Korean here for dinner. We shared the yechon special 1 and got a sundubu and kimchi bibimbap. I thought that the food was good as did my husband, but my parents were not impressed. They said everything was very under seasoned and they blackened the galbi too much which I thought was true. The service is also pretty notoriously rude and bad, but I've gotten used to it. My friends and I enjoy this place but I think it's only average for ""real"" Koreans perhaps ;)Oh and we were sweating the whole time under the ac unit! When we complained how hot it was they just told is the ac is on. Pretty rude and sadly typical of his place."
Kimberly S.,"Washington, DC",4/26/2016,3.0,"It pains me to say this because it means I'm old but I've been a proud Yechon customer for over a decade. It's one of the first places I was introduced to for late night Korean BBQ (aka: the only way to do Korean BBQ) after a night of drinking.Now that I've matured, my late night Korean BBQ binges have not stopped only instead of it being a post club activity, it's more of a post Netflix binging activity (Grace & Frankie for dayyyyyzzzzzz). And it's just as reliable as ever!They have sushi, they have bibimbap with the crispy rice edges, and of course grilled meat galore! The service is brisk and the food is consistently good (it's not the best in town but at 2 in the morning it sure beats IHOP). Banchan selection is nice but you can definitely get a better value of quality, quantity and taste elsewhere."
Dior N.,"Orlando, FL",9/10/2016,5.0,"BEEESSSSTTTTT KOREAN BBQ IVE EVER HAD! We always get soooo much food and have a bunch to take home every time. I love the banchan here too! The purple rice with beans is my favorite. My family and I go here whenever I come to visit and we always get sushi too, the fish is very fresh and this is one of the places that have good uni! Be prepared for a long wait if you go around dinner time though. I've waited over an hour before but it's soooooo worth it! There's also a cute bakery next door!"
Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",7/11/2016,4.0,"What a Fantastic Korean restaurant that opens 24 hour!! Tried it for the first time was more than impressed, especially their complimentary, tasty panchan (see uploaded photo); this alone is worthy a return trip. Notwithstanding a busy place, services rendered were pretty good. They have very comprehensive menu, which include Japanese specialties, such as sushi, udon, sashimi, etc. As for their prices, I think approximately $30.00 for the kalbi/galbi plate (one person) was kind of on the high side, but I guess that is what we pay for quality, since the beef was very tender & tasty. Will check out their lunch offering next time."
Matt H.,"Arlington, VA",1/22/2017,5.0,"I started going to Yechon back in high school and have been a devoted fan ever since. You get a lot of great food for your money and, if you order a couple of Korean barbecue plates, they'll cook it in front of you. As good as the meat is, in many ways the best part of the meal is trying all the random sides. If you're trying to figure out what to get on the slightly-confusing menu, I highly recommend the dwaeji bulgogi (slightly spicy).It can be packed in there but they cycle people through like crazy. NB: you may have to push the call button on the edge of your table if you need service, but that's acceptable.Plus, this place is open 24 hours--how awesome is that?!"
James N.,"Orlando, FL",2/14/2017,4.0,"Great good, service, and price! I loved my first experience here.  Service was quick and food came out in under 15 minutes even though it was crowded.  I shared a seafood pancake, kim chi soup, and beef and rice rice bowl.  All were good especially for the price!"
Yvonne L.,"Vienna, VA",7/3/2016,3.0,"Pros: open 24/7, next door to a great dessert place (Breeze), decent food, good side dishes Cons: the Korean BBQ is nothing special and the meat portion size is quite small, you have to order at least two portions of bulgogi so dinner can get quite pricey"
Kaley C.,"Safety Harbor, FL",11/27/2015,4.0,"We were in the mood for Korean, so we drove out to Annandale because Yechon has all the hype! Since my dinner guests and I have all lived in Korea, we have pretty high standards for Korean food and Yechon lived up to our expectations. Everything is very authentic from the restaurant being open 24/7, to the service buttons on the table, and the dishes straight from Korea. Servers wore traditional hanbok, which was a nice touch. The menu has a ton of pages and options with English translations. Surprisingly, no pictures! We ordered family style- soju and Cass, samgapsal, bulgogi, goju panjeon, and mandu. Only some of the meat could be grilled at the table, I'm guessing due to the size of the grill, but they brought the samgapsal out raw and some of he other meat was brought out cooked. The timing of the food was perfect and it was nice having a server helping us with the grill. Although we could have done it ourselves, we were all chowing down on the banchan options so it was nice to not have to monitor the meat. The mandu was excellent and the goju panjeon was SPICY, beware! The server said one of the meat dishes would serve one person, but that was a bit of an exaggeration. We had 6 people and ordered 4 portions of meat along with the panjeon and mandu and were very satisfied. It was actually a bit too much food. We leisurely ate and were not rushed out at the end of our meal. It's a bit pricey as far as Asian food goes and downright expensive if comparing to cost in Korea (but that's just silly). Overall good quality food, authentic atmosphere, and a nice night!"

I got the bill for $68 all i had on my wallet $74 so I gave the waitress $6 tip, she was upset and demented a bigger tip that should be $10.20 and embarrassing me in front of my family and other customers.A tip should be optioned, I recommend any one eating there should be aware of my experience. otherwise they will embarrassing you or your family one day.Terrible customer service."
Nancy O.,"Falls Church, VA",12/30/2016,4.0,"I love many of the Korean dishes, especially the Bibimbap!  The BBQ Galbi and chicken is very good, but lacks the marinated-for-days taste you get in other Korean restaurants. I think it looses a star on the Japanese portion of the menu. The sushi station is not 24 hours, which was a huge disappointment to a few people on my party. To compensate they ordered Japanese dishes that just didn't measure up. The yakitori is ok. The Chicken teriyaki was blah. Tempura was ok too, but you can't go wrong with frying anything covered in tempura!"
Amber M.,"Vienna, VA",4/6/2016,1.0,"I decide to come there have my birthday party with my friends (todal 6 people that day) because since we always go Honey Pig BBQ, so I wanna try somewhere else. By checking out the reviews people did to them, I thought here will be 2nd place we can go for korean food and drinks. BUT I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.1. NOT FRIENDLY GREETING. 2. FOOD IS OK, BUT NO WAITRESS HELPS US GRILLING.3. THE REFUSE TO HELP YOU CHANGE THE BURNING GRILLING PLATE.(This is the worst part that night. After those marinated meat done, we should grilling or (reheat) our lobster on grilling plate. However, the plate was turning black and the smokes were killing us. The waitress we call, she just side,"" No need to change, because the meat is marinated, it's all done. You can turn the grill off."" Come on, didn't you see we have other ingredients need to grill???  So we just turn the grilling with the low heat and let it barely heat the lobster up. But the lobster became a disaster, half cooked and get the strong burning taste.'4. THEY DON'T LIKE YOU TO ASK.We got a birthday cake that night, so we like to ask for some plates to share the cake, the old guy with eyeglasses came again and look at us........ WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR, DONT STAND THERE AND STARING AT US.  He was really make people feel sick, not comfortable at all.NOOOOOOOOOOT BACK AGAIN!!!! EVER!!!!!"
William J.,"Washington, DC",4/9/2017,1.0,"I would have given this place zero stars if it would let me. For me a restaurant is more than just the food. It's the overall experience and the convenience of having something that you may not have at home. The service was simply abysmal. Probably the most inattentive server I've ever encountered in a restaurant. We only saw him twice; when he took the order and when he gave me the bill. I made it known when we sat down that it was our first time there, so one would think that they would get to make a good impression; boy was I wrong. I think the only time the server would have even noticed us is if we got up and tried to leave without paying. We almost did since we asked three different servers for our check after having waited thirty minutes for our server. This experience was not all together negative. The one plus was the food which I felt was of good quality. I was disappointed to learn that the sushi bar was closed but it would have been nice knowing that when we were sat down. Overall, my experience was crappy and I will not return. There are better restaurants out there with similar or the same offering with better service."
Sun H.,"Rockville, MD",6/4/2017,5.0,I've been here about twice and I was satisfied each time.The service is great and I ordered various meats to be grilled in my table as well as Korean rice wine and soju.I love all of them!They gave plenty of side dishes and were kind and friendly when I asked for refill.Waitress came to help us grill and cut up the meat.They were delicious so I recommend this place.
Nika V.,"Alexandria, VA",8/12/2017,4.0,"Great for a late night dinner. They are fast and super polite. It does get crowded but I've never waited for a table for more than 20 min there even on a busy night. The parking lot is a little annoying and I wish the waiting area was larger, but the food is good."
Sindy L.,"McLean, VA",6/10/2017,4.0,"Fairly priced, overall service is soso, food is always mediocre. Plus side is that they're open 24/7. Bakery shop next door makes a perfect spot for dessert"
Ryan Z.,"Washington, DC",6/4/2016,3.0,"I finally made it to a Korean bbq, and while I had a good time, it's really not for me.  Also, as a first-time, non-Korean, I struggled a bit to figure out what to order, how much to order, and even how to order!  Fortunately, looking at other tables and pointing and saying ""I want that"" works pretty good.There are many options for grilled ""bbq"" meats, many of which are grilled at your table. They generally require 2 orders, and some you can mix and match with different meats, whereas others you can't (very confusing, and the language barrier didn't help on this topic).  We ordered the brisket, and that was a bit of a mistake.  The meat had no flavor until dipped in a sauce or paired with a little side...they bring out all these little dishes with various sauces or sides like seaweed...but honestly I had no idea what anything was, and none of the flavors were really for me.  The bulgogi or spicy chicken, which are marinated, probably had more flavor.Onto other dishes...the Korean pancakes are pretty good.  They are also huge.  Ours had shrimp and squid.  I didn't like the pork dish we got.  It ended up being totally different from the images in our mind from the menu description.  What we got was a plate of fatty pork belly (lukewarm), a pile of steamed cabbage, a mound of kimchi, and a bunch of cloves of garlic.  Individually or together, I didn't care for any of it.  Our streak of ordering things and getting something we didn't expect continued with the chicken dish, which ended up being sweet and sour chicken in a goopey, sweet sauce.  Had I know it was going to be that, I would have never ordered it.  Also, for 3 hungry people, we ordered way too much food because the portions are massive.Service was fine, though the waitresses only make contact when you're ready to order.  I loved that they wore traditional outfits, which really adds to the cultural experience."
Elizabeth K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/31/2016,4.0,"They weren't lying! Yechon is bustling with people at all hours of the day! We walked in at 11pm and the waiting area was PACKED!Now here's the thing: My main gripe about Yechon is that they need to develop a better wait system. For first-timers like me, I wasn't aware that they didn't have a wait list. We just saw people crowded in the front so we naturally made our way through the crowd (of course with people giving us the stink eye) only to be informed by the man that we just need to wait in line. What line? It was just a mesh of people all out of place! Whatever. At least put a sign or something? Wait wasn't too bad. I think we got seated within 10 minutes? Side dishes all tasted very good. We ordered the galbi dolsat bibimbap and the galbi tang. I didn't like the sauce (chogochujang aka red pepper paste mixed with vinegar) that accompanied the galbi dolsot. I'm more of a gochujang & sesame oil type of girl. Theirs was too tangy for my liking and ruined the overall groove of the dish. AND they used too much bean sprouts! I hate bean sprouts and that was basically half the dish! But overall, it was pretty tasty and had nice chunks of galbi in them. Galbitang was delightful. Flavor was rich & deep and all together soothing. Good amount of meat in the soup! Super random: I was amazed at how well Yechon was ventilated. Most of the tables surrounding us had BBQ grills on their tables and if it was anywhere else, that meat smell would have clinged onto anything and everything on my body. Sure it smells delicious but not exactly the scent I would like following me around. + points for that, Yechon! Service was alright. I mean, I could clearly see that they were busy so I didn't expect much from the beginning. It was hard to flag our waiter at times, but he was still quick & efficient."
Prairie S.,"Arlington, VA",9/7/2015,5.0,"What else can I give but a 5, for the gift of an escape (even if illusory) from the soulless, indistinguishable 'burbs of greater Washington to a dark, wooden shop bustling with all the toil and relish of a Korean kitchen?  This ethnic restaurant wraps its menu offerings in the full-blown cultural experience of the cuisine. The majority of its patrons appear to be Korean families; they obviously feel well catered to here. Walking in from the dedicated parking lot (which appears to be in expansion mode) you are greeted by a waitress in full Korean costume complete with delicate, embroidered blouse. She courteously and efficiently escorts you to an open table (no wait at a recent weekend lunch time) and hands you a massive menu.  Lots of adequately-described and well-edited English translations of menu items are available (hallelujah!)The restaurant has a full sushi bar and 2 pages worth of Japanese offerings, which we skipped because...Korean. A quick scan of my trusty Yelp app and quick conference with my mostly vegetarian dining companion, and we've settled on the scallion/chilli pancake which I have been rather craving, as well as a spicy stew with rice.  I am partial to food that resembles Indian plating, so the choices make me happy (translates as: I'm  getting a Korean version of a stuffed paratha and rice with curry! Yay!) The panchan arrives first followed by the food in short order. No noticeable wait.  The waitress served the pancake by cutting it with scissors into triangle wedges, and patiently tolerated my anthropologist-style questioning about the correct pronunciation of ""pajeon"".  We start chomping on the hot and slightly greasy pancake combined with the various panchan. Wholly delicious, though I did desire an even more fermented, overpowering version of the kimchi than the one they served.We dived into the vegetarian stew whose vegetables were basically zuchinni, soft tofu, and onion, but whose seriously-spiced, seafood-based broth offered lots of clams/shrimps/chunks of fish, with strong fishy, umami? flavor.  Now I'm not one to shy from spice and strong flavor, but the thing was literally simmering at the table and I needed it to cool down.  Korean spiciness is cooked into the broth, so it wasn't like biting into a raw Thai or Mexican chilli bomb where your lips tend to go numb and you have to coat your tongue in dairy balm to be able to taste anything again. This heat just leaves you panting. Good panting though.We were just stuffed, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves being surrounded by Koreans and their exquisitely presented foods.  Perhaps the only thing lost in translation here was a sign I saw in the bathroom stall, saying ""No Dumping"".  They are missing some kind of object at the end of that imperative construction, perhaps ""trash items"".  No matter."
Gretchen F.,"Burke, VA",3/4/2016,4.0,"Delicious meats, banchan galore, and the biggest damn seafood pancake you'll ever see in your life. I understand why Yechon is so often people's go-to on the KBBQ front! You need to request a grill table when you come in or you might be seated at a regular table, where they cook the meat in the back and bring it out to you. Or maybe that's your preference! I personally love KBBQ for the same reason I'm nuts about fondue -- something about paying someone else so I can cook my own food just really speaks to me, you know? The galbi was particularly delicious (they cooked this in the back even though we sat at a grill table), and they don't skimp on the sauces, lettuce, rice, or whatever else you need to make your meaty meal complete. The only drawback for this place is that the bill can rack up right quick, since each meat must be ordered separately (no AYCE options here.)The ajumas were pleasant and efficient, and it was a great lunchtime option! I hear this place gets packed to the nines on weekends and at dinnertime, but the good news is that it's open literally 24/7, so if you're worried about facing a crowd, you can always just come get your Korean barbeque fix at like, 4 AM. Breakfast of champions."
Ed C.,"Charlotte, NC",11/26/2016,5.0,"this place is awesome.  the food was too numerous but the main dishes were bulgogi,  kalbee, pork, were all great"
J L.,"Washington, DC",7/28/2017,4.0,"Got seated quickly for it being so packed. Numerous choices on food menu, food came quickly. Ordered kalbi bibimbop = delicious. Having said that, super loud, had to shout which is kinda defeating. Had to ask for water, and eventually got kicked out because they needed the table they said. Food is good, open 24/7 so maybe at a less pronounced time frame. Parking next to a bakery too which is nice. 4 stars because the food is good, but way too packed and noisy."
Jessica C.,"Falls Church, VA",5/12/2017,4.0,"Solid Korean BBQ in a traditional setting.  They are nice and VERY efficient.  Please also try the galbi dolsot bibim bap.  It's spare rib meat, rice, veggies, in a very hot stone pot.  You mix it all together with a spicy sauce.  It forms a delicious crust on the bottom of the bowl.  Soul satisfying on a cold day. Bonus: afterwards, go to Breeze Bakery next door.  Get bingsoo: a dish of shared ice, yogurt, and a bunch of other stuff on top (per your preference). Delightful!"
Sam L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",8/24/2015,4.0,"After 900+ reviews for Yechon, I'll sum it here: great food, spotty service, 24-hours, and they don't take reservations.We recently celebrated a friend's birthday, who was craving for Korean food (and not the buffet Iron Age or Honeypig style).  There are limited ""good"" options in Maryland so we decided to venture out to Annandale, where there are plenty of options.  Knowing Yechon's reputation, we decided to come here for an early Sunday dinner and even then there was a wait.The first thing you'll notice is like most Korean restaurants, your clothes and ultimately sweat will smell like cooked meat.  Even if you decide not to get Korean BBQ, you'll definitely smell it from one of your neighbor's tables.  Good luck getting a menu during peak hours, so you'll have to employ the ol' traditional Asian tactic, which is flag down anyone and everyone that works there (busboy included).  Their portion sizes are fairly generous and any food that says ""for two people,"" it's really for 3-4 people.  So not knowing, we ordered an outrageous amount but still ended up finishing majority (what can I say, we loved the food).  We ordered a seafood hot pot, bossam, seafood pancake and chicken fried rice - all were super good.I subtracted one star because their service was spotty, where we often couldn't flag anyone down or any requests take a good 10 minutes to get.  They also didn't have oysters, like at all.  No oysters for the bossam (shouldn't that be cheaper then?) or oyster pancake.  That's a pretty big deal.Pro tip: Korean fried rice is unlike your Chinese and other style, it's definitely tasty. Pro tip II: there isn't a designated waiter/waitress, so embrace the Asian culture, take the initiative and flag down anyone who works there to place orders, extra napkins, extra bowls, ask questions, and get recommendation for dessert (Siroo is the place to go afterwards)"
Anny L.,"Fairfax, VA",11/5/2016,2.0,"I like that this restaurant is  24 hours and has sushi and Korean cuisine.  Their sushi has fair price and the size is great. What I don't like was our server. He is a young guy.  He has some attitude when we were not ready to order the food at first time.  Then, He has the time to ask our neighbor whether they ready to order, he didn't even bother to look if we need more water.  We didn't get empty plate to start side dishes. I had to ask twice.  When we ask for check, we waited 20mins, I thought he is busy until we see our server has time to get checks for other tables, we asked the check three times in total. So disappoint"
Saiyan A.,"Manassas, VA",1/22/2017,5.0,This place never dissapoints. If youre looking for Korean food come here. Open 24 hours and the pricing of everything is very reasonable. Hot food served to order. The bon chon is verrrrry fresh and good. Portion size is excellent.Best korean restaurant in the area.Thanks Yechon!
Jie S.,"Washington, DC",5/14/2016,5.0,"Hands down the best kimchi jiggae in the DMV. I usually only come here for the lunch special ($6.95 to $9.95 for different kinds of jiggaes and over entrees). I always get the kimchi jiggae and it never disappoints.If you're a kimchi jiggae fan like me, you know the key is the sourness of the kimchi. They must have a bucket in the back of the kitchen that they leave out there for years because the kimchi is perfectly sour and makes the soup really rich and flavorful. There's nothing like waking up on a cold morning with a hearty jiggae.As for their dinner options, I think their menu is too big so they don't do anything especially well (except the kimchi jiggae) but everything is decent. I definitely wouldn't come here for BBQ though, there's way better places that specialize in that.Lunch special-wise, my favorite restaurant in Annandale."
Angela J.,"Dumfries, VA",5/27/2017,5.0,"ABSOLUTELY delicious Korean feast. .dinner with friends Barbara and so Theo. Seafood, ribs, veggies and rice"
James M.,"Alexandria, VA",5/11/2017,5.0,"This place deserves five stars because it serves the best tasty good quality Kalbi in Washington area. Sooooo good.!!!!!!!Also this place is 24 hours and they have a huge menu. Granted they aren't Korean bbq place, there's still so much to like here. Everyone I've taken here has not been disappointed. It's not like super fancy nor hole-in-the-wall type. I can't believe how busy it gets here but hey, people know what's good.Another favorite that I have here is their Korean seafood pancake. Jesus Christ - has lot's of sea item in it, a crispy exterior, and is also chewy on the inside. I definitely recommend ordering this as an appetizer or side if you haven't yet tried it. It tastes great with the dipping sauce  soy sauce that they serve along with it. So good.^^"
Ylonda C.,"Washington, DC",2/22/2016,2.0,"I was soooo craving Yechon. So to get there and be totally disappointed was really a bummer.  I never go there expecting great service, but yesterday was even lower than normal.  There were two women helping us. One was pleasant but the other was the worst! She would barely slow down enough for us to ask a question. I got the bibimbap with ground beef and the other with seafood.  I'm still looking for the beef.  I couldn't find it but was told it was there....brings back the old Wendy's saying ""Where's the beef?!?!""  (Yes I'm dating myself).  Then the friend egg was so hard and overcooked.  The seafood was also overcooked. Even had I not taken a long drive from DC...I would've been extremely disappointed.  Not sure I will go back."
Katie S.,"Springfield, VA",2/19/2016,4.0,"So, I'm late to the party. But it's better late then never, right? Hubs and I wandered into Yechon on Valentine's day trying to avoid the typical sappy Valentine's day trap and I am so happy with this decision it's not even funny.  Instead of cheesy plastic red hearts everywhere we were greeted with 8+ pages of amazing sounding food and found it incredibly hard to decide what we wanted. In the end, we ended up getting a little bit of everything by splitting the Yechon Special menu #2 (for 2 people).  And let me just tell you, it's a LOT of food for $50! We got all sorts of delicious banchan, several huge delectable pieces of sashimi, a large portion of bulgogi, a large portion of spicy pan fried squid, grilled mackerel, bean pastepot stew (that comes out molten lava hot-be careful here!), gamasot bop and two beers (choice of Bud or Miller). Seriously, it was a ridiculous amount of food for that amount of money! Everything was super tasty, I didn't love the purple rice (gamasot bop), but that's kind of an acquired taste from what I understand. Everything else was phenomenal.  The sashimi in particular was amazing; I wish I had taken a picture of how perfect it was.  You could tell by the color of the fish it was going to be good and it did not disappoint.  Also, the spicy pan fried squid and the cold vinegary mashed potatoes (one of the banchan offerings) together are one of the best flavor combos I have ever put in my mouth. I'm actually making myself hungry just thinking about it right now. Haha.The restaurant is bigger inside than it looks outside and is sparely decorated, but is quite charming. Service was great.  Everyone was super friendly.  I also love the orange slices to cool your mouth at the end of a great meal. What a lovely touch. I can't wait to come back and try more things off their extensive menu and am totally kicking myself it took us so long to get here!"
R J.,"Arlington, VA",5/16/2017,5.0,Amazzziiinnggg food!! The chicken bulgogi is amazing. the service is always fast and respectful. Vents are always turned on to prevent smoke but then turned off as to not interrupt your dinner. The staff is respectful and the sister bakery next door is also amazing and has great ice cream
Meghann P.,"Downey, CA",4/29/2017,4.0,"This place is reputable and well known to the Asian community in VA.  The food lived up to the hype and the portion were generous.  Our children loved their bulgogi and yakisoba.  The place also looked presentable and clean.  Was diggin' the servers' uniform as well, however, the only negative thing I noticed was the servers seemed cold with flat affect.  Didn't offer to refill drinks.  Just took our orders and brought the food out. There was also a server brushing her teeth and putting on make up in the small women's restroom but that wasn't too bothersome to me; just seemed a bit strange. Overall, was a good experience and would definitely go back again if we're ever in the area."
Ann P.,"Washington, DC",7/19/2015,3.0,"I have been here so many times and each time I can never get them past the three star point. The pro! They are open 24/7. How perfect is that? You can eat here after playing in DC! When I came here last night, after a long night of partying, the service was slow. I asked them for more ban chan and they took forever. I had to ask them three times to get more ban chan. I would say their udon is a 2/5. It is not that great. The shrimp tempura is the best part of the dish. The shrimp tempura is crispy and crunchy. The broth is muddy and not refreshing as you would find at other restaurants. The soonduboo is a 4/5. It's not too spicy that's why I loved it! The actually soft tofu in the soup makes the dish a 4! The soonduboo is soft and melts in your mouth. They give you big chucks of it which I love! The bimbimbap is not the bolsook bimbimbap so it does not come in the traditional clay pots."
Hyewon L.,"Falls Church, VA",4/22/2016,3.0,"I've been to yechon many times because it's one of those places you can always go at any time of the day - because it's 24 hours. Most of my friends and I come here during the after hours of going out. Around 3 am or 4am. It's the go to spot in the DMV area for Koreans because you can get dol-sot-bibimbop and other stews for a good price. However, I have mixed reviews about this place. Some of their items like the bibimbop is really good and some of their stews come out very bland. The service here is variable, because I come here during late night hours and the waiters aren't that friendly. All in all, for late night grubs for an affordable price, I would recommend. But if you're looking for some authentic Korean food during the day, I think there's plenty of other restaurants in the area that could do better than yechon."
Andre B.,"Cedar Hill, TX",4/16/2017,5.0,"For this place to be open 24/7, the food was soooooooo fresh! I cannot wait to go back! We came at the right time. About 20 minutes after we sat down, then a huge crowd came in! I cannot wait to bring some more of my friend's here! Thank you for such a great experience!"
YuhLi T.,"Queens, NY",10/10/2016,3.0,Love the fact that this place is 24 hours. Came here at around 10:30pm on a Saturday night. I was fine that they stuffed us in a corner but not too happy that we had to constantly wave down our waiter when we needed him because he rarely came to check up on us. Overall food is what you'd expect from a 24 hour Korean restaurant. I got the soondooboo which hit the spot for me. It had plenty of tofu but the beef was chewy.
Ann L.,"Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA",3/12/2016,5.0,"There were tons of people! But we didn't wait cuz we sat at the sushi bar.The seafood pancake is so giant!!! It's yummmy! My favorite dish. The sushi is ok. We ordered the eel sushi and assorted one. The service is ok too, cuz they didn't refill my water unless I requested. Personally, when evaluating service, I'm a nerd in terms of refill water, thought it's free, haha.I will recommend this spot. I'd like to order barbecue here if I feel like eating meat in the future. But if you go to sushi, this may not be the best choice."
Jenny H.,"Baltimore, MD",10/1/2016,4.0,"This place has really good Korean food. I came here for lunch and ordered a bunch of things, including their dolsot bibimbap (Korean hot stone veggie rice dish), their soon dubu jigae (spicy tofu soup which was AWESOME, better than other specialized tofu places), their tofu appetizer (also good, chunks of tofu with spicy sauce) and their meat BBQ- their meats and banchan (side dishes) were all so good! I was really impressed with this place because it was better than I expected. It's better than typical Korean food elsewhere."
Sallie L.,"Arlington, VA",10/12/2016,4.0,"Atmosphere: Busy!!!! Be ready to wait if you are here during dinner hours! It's bustling and on the noisier side.Food: I have been here a few times before and I tried a few different dishes. This time I had the Hwedupbap - basically sashimi and greens over rice, mixed with korean sweet red pepper paste sauce. Delicious. This is actually one of my favorite dishes but haven't had a place I trusted to order! Yechon did not diasppoint. It was a good amount of fish and great ratio of greens. I highly recommend it! My hubby had the tofu soup which also was very good (although he mumbled about the egg he was missing which they provide at light house tofu -- but yechon's way is usually the way they serve it in Korea!). The banchans were on point and left this picky Korean very happy at the end of the meal.Service: Waters were filled quickly and service was not too pushy (aka. hover over me every 5 minutes) and to the point which was good since we were here to just eat and bounce.Overall: 4.8/5 - I do wish it was a bit quieter at times but nonetheless we will be back!!"
Dean G.,"Washington, DC",11/15/2016,4.0,"Positives: Open 24 hours.  Large menu they execute decently well.  Negatives, other places do everything they do better, but no one place is as versatile {so a con thruns into a positive I guess}  Again, aside fromt he 24 hour issue, I prefer other spots."
Al A.,"Edison, NJ",10/20/2016,3.0,Great bbq. Longish wait. The food was good but the service staff was stretched thin. Dropped star for that.Overall worth if you want good Korean food. Maybe too crowded and a bit too efficient to keep the guests moving for some.
Katrina D.,"Woodbridge, VA",7/16/2017,5.0,This is our 3rd time here and as always it is GREAT!! Soo full and happy. Great service and great food!!! We will definitely be back!!
Ly K.,"Chicago, IL",1/4/2017,4.0,"If you ask me about the food, I'd say it's decent. So what keeps me coming back? Their fine parking lot--it's the best in the city."
Allison I.,"Richmond, VA",1/11/2016,4.0,"Delicious 24hour korean restaurant on the edge of Annandale. It's a traditional korean restaurant that offers huge amounts of marinaded galbi, bulgogi, terriyaki, seafoods and soups. Took my cousins here who studied abroad in Korea and she was impressed with their flavors. The servers all wear traditional korean gowns and give complimentary bonchon ( this isn't the fried chicken, it's actually small side dishes).  This place is clean, food is great and servers are very attentive. Overall, I would always recommend this joint in town!"
Jean S.,"Kirkland, WA",5/19/2015,4.0,"I have been going to Yechon for decades (yikes, I'm old) - it was always a favorite late night eats place after clubbing in DC with friends. Now that I'm much older, I appreciate this institution, which not only has stayed in business for so long in an area with lots of failed Korean restaurants, it is busier than ever! Whether I go in for their early breakfast special or during the mad busy lunch time, this place is so packed, it's hard to find parking.Their Korean food is solid - nothing extraordinary, but it is just honest-to-goodness homecooked Korean comfort food. My family likes that they have a sushi bar, because we all love their hwe dup bap, which is sashimi and fresh veggies served over rice with spicy red pepper paste. Last time my family dined here, we ordered a variety of foods to include hwe dup bap, udon with shrimp tempura, kalbi tang, soft tofu stew, mae woong tang (spicy cod fish stew) and hae jang gook (blood cube soup, aka ""hangover soup""). Despite being super busy (I really think there were no empty tables), the wait staff was efficient and very friendly.Sure, Yechon isn't the most exciting place to go for Korean food, but when I want food like my Mom makes at home, this is where I would go."
Sandy H.,"Manassas, VA",9/7/2016,5.0,The galbi dol sol bibimbap! So good! Or if you don't go too late the sushi bibimbap! This place is great because of all the banchan (side dishes) honestly you could just get rice and eat that!
Michelle C.,"Washington, DC",6/25/2016,1.0,"If you have really niche preferences for mediocre Korean food (at best) with terrible service, here is your place.I've been here over ten times (mostly because my old fashion grandparents who only know restaurants from like 10 years ago and insist on solely patronizing those establishments want to go here.) I've never been wowed and consistently been disappointed, so I've decided it's time to take my grievances public.Pluses:- it's open 24 hours- the food is o...k...Minuses:- the service is terrible, I mean grade A awful (caveat: only have had poor experiences with the male staff there who I assume are managerial as suggested by their dress; the female daytime servers were alright)- not only are the staff incredibly rude, but they don't want to be there and it's entirely evident- they also kind of throw all of the side dishes on the table, so much so that they spilt salt all over the table and into my water. did they come back to clean it up? I could only dream. We had extra salty side dishes the entire time - terrible communication from staff: I asked for an ice water twice, and didn't get anything for 10 minutes. Then I reminded the irate server who angrily grunted ""ok"" and then 15 minutes later three different people bring ice water- also don't come here if you're hungry because it takes forever for the food to come outBottom line: Annandale has plenty of restaurants, and incredibly robust 24 hour scene. There are much better options. I consider myself a generous Yelper but I've been spurned one too many times by giving this place another chance. I'm out."
Donald L.,"San Francisco, CA",10/2/2016,3.0,"Hey it's open 24hrs!  That's rare for any place in this area.  The food is alright, not the best meat I ever had but decent quality. Service is typical nothing special.  Did I say it's open 24 hrs!"
Irene S.,"Las Vegas, NV",6/30/2017,2.0,"Food was average..had better. Service was bad. A cousin and I had to wait 10 minutes for a water refill even though they passed our table several times. Then they gave us a small takeout box for our extra meat even though we asked for a big one because there was more than extra meat. At the end we signed our check and gave a tip that we thought was reasonable ($3). We walk out of the restaurant and we notice a server who never served our table chase after us. He straight up said ""oh was our service bad because we didn't get the amount of tip we listed here"". First of all, we were thoughtful enough to even give a tip for low quality service. Secondly, we did not see any signs or were told about a gratuity service for a party of 2 with different checks. I don't think we were obligated to give a 15% ($10) tip. Just the fact that the server came out to chase us was a shame. We won't be coming here again. Despite the rave reviews, there are better. Maybe we had a bad experience but that's enough for us to know that they're not worth it."
Doris Y.,"Reston, VA",12/19/2016,5.0,"Always in the mood for some Korean food, especially in winter. Their pancakes are great and large for a group to split as appetizer. I am a huge fan of the bibimbap in a stone pot."
Kevin H.,"Chantilly, VA",8/21/2016,5.0,"I was seated right when I came in despite it being so busy. I ordered broiled salted mackerel. It came out very quick even though it was so busy. They also give out plenty of side dishes like kimchi, burdock root, pickled cucumbers, miso soup, and rice. Everything was delicious. My only problem was that the hot oil from the mackerel dish was splashing on me a little bit but that was over in no time. They are very quick even when they are busy. I will come back again to try their other items."
Albert A.,"Fairfax, VA",4/16/2017,5.0,"It's busy, but the food is worth it.  I had a large group of friends arrive, and yes they were quite busy, but they were accommodating and still friendly.  The food is always wonderful and I am always looking forward to eating here!"
William F.,"Washington, DC",7/16/2016,3.0,"Gotta say I wasn't impressed with this place. Ambiance is nicer than honey pig, but I didn't feel the meat was as flavorful. I do like the banchan here better. One major flaw was that the hot plate that cooked our food was to the side of the table (4 of us were seated together). The waitress placed the meat, once it was cooked, into serving bowls on the table. I feel like this detracted from the korean bbq experience. I live for the browned bits on the bottom of the hot plate! I couldn't get to them in the middle of this family restaurant without seeming like a savage and scarring nearby families for weeks to come. Seafood scallion pancake appetizer was huge and packed with flavor, but a bit too greasy. Overall, a solid korean bbq option, but in Annandale korean bbq is a dime a dozen and I feel like there are better options nearby."
Jamie M.,"Washington, DC",3/27/2017,5.0,I Love this place.  Open 24/7/365 .. yes it is.  Gets very busy at times but usually you can get right in.  Very traditional Korean food & oh so delicious !  The waitresses are traditionally dressed & very attentive.  They keep you happy .  They have a sign up saying children must be kept in line which is a refreshing attitude as nothing makes a dining experience more uncomfortable as screaming kids or children wandering around.  I see a lot of families with children but most families are Korean and dads will get up and stroll with babies & little ones in their arms to keep them content & little bit older children all sit quiet eating.  A very family orientated restaurant in that respect. The food is plentiful & the aromas are enticing.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.
Caitrin O.,"London, United Kingdom",3/1/2015,4.0,"After a recent trip to South Korea, my friend and I have been wanting to share the joy of Korean BBQ with our other DC friends. We stopped by Yechon at 6:30 on a Saturday night because Kogiya was booked through 9 PM. Two of our party arrived early (bless them) and put our names down. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table for 6, which wasn't too bad because it was an opportunity to scope out the awesome bakery next door! The atmosphere is more subdued and family-focused than Honey Pig and other KBBQ spots, but the food was great and the prices are pretty awesome. We ordered two orders of bulgogi, one of pork belly, and one of the thin-sliced brisket. The waitress said that wouldn't be enough food so we also got a scallion and seafood pancake, which was delicious. We left extremely full and each person's tab with a drink was $20- not too shabby when other locations are charging $25-30 per person before alcohol. Overall it was a fantastic dinner at a great price. Things to note: 1) Only a few meats are actually cooked tableside. The bulgogi was my favorite but they cooked it in the kitchen and then brought it out on plates. I guess they are trying to save time and let people order as many different dishes as possible, but Yechon eliminates my favorite part about Korean BBQ, which is getting to cook the meat myself, which isn't allowed- even for the ""cook at table"" meats, only the waitresses are allowed to use the tongs. 2) The parking situation is an absolute nightmare. It is basically impossible to find a spot unless someone happens to be leaving at the same time as you arrive. I'd suggest factoring this into your commute time. 3) Go to the bakery next door. It is very cute and a fun experience!"
Julia K.,"Orange County, CA",1/22/2017,5.0,Is it weird to eat at the same restaurant for 3 nights in a row?? The Korean panchan and main dishes are so exquisitely prepared and authentic that we are literally eating our way through their menu. Hope they don't get tired of seeing us everyday!!!
Vince K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",10/12/2016,5.0,"Found this place on Yelp since I was craving Korean BBQ but not AYCE. This place is open 24 hours, the servers are all dressed in traditional dresses. I sat at the sushi bar since I was eating solo and ordered a sushi deluxe, mool mandoo, marinated galbi. My server didn't think I could possibly finish all that I ordered but I proved her wrong haha. The food was really good and I liked the restaurant."
Kristen C.,"Duluth, GA",7/1/2016,5.0,"Totally a fan of this place.  It's open 24 hours (so you know it's always open) I came here while driving from Atlanta to Philadelphia at like 1am and stopped here for a quick meal while travelling.  We ordered one of the Yechon Specials (Combo 1), it came with sashimi, beef ribs, dumpling soup, mung bean pancake, mackerel, bean paste soup, banchan.  All the food was pretty good (banchan really good!).  This combo worked really well for us because I love sashimi, and my boyfriend really likes the bbq that was included with it."
Sue K.,"Pasadena, CA",12/2/2015,4.0,"Having moved from NY recently, we were looking for a Korean restaurant that didn't specialize in anything, but offered a wide range of dishes. It can get pretty tricky with places specializing in bbq, gom tang, school food, etc. It is hard to find a restaurant that is 'good' (enough) across the board. We've done a take out from seoul garden so we decided to visit yechon.Went on a saturday.1. BUSYBUSYBUSY - not sure if they're always busy. but they are a 24 hour establishment. The line was out the door. But we got a table pretty quickly.2. Hanbok - everyone wears hanbok, well the servers. I thought it was nice to see pretty dresses as their uniform.3. Food: we ordered hwe dup bap, sul lung tang, and ojinuh bokkum with mungbean pancakes as apps. they were all very good. The banchans were good, too. They offered a wide array of banchans. Hwe dup bap had a generous portion of fish.4. service: again, they were busy - so we had to flag down our servers to get napkins, more banchan, our check, etc. We'll be back, most definitely. There's a bakery right next to them, which makes it convenient to get dessert after."
Kin K.,"Washington, DC",12/29/2015,4.0,Most Amazing Galbi with very generous side dishes! We came on a Saturday when the restaurant was crowded but the staff moved quickly and were attentive too! Our crab soup was not as good and they forgot to bring us the crab opener even though we adked for it couple times.
Kim N.,"San Francisco, CA",6/28/2017,3.0,the food was very mediocre for the hype. the fried rice was salty.
Dats V.,"Falls Church, VA",5/25/2016,1.0,"Title: TERRIBLE SERVICECame here for a celebratory dinner on a Sunday.  I tried to go early to avoid it but there was still a short wait for a table.Ordered tempura appetizer, salmon sushi roll, and brisket & pork belly bbq.Everything was fine... the tempura and sushi being the surprisingly good items of the bunch!the bbq meats were kind of meh actually.However the reason for the low review was the SERVICE.it was busy.  but its always busy here.it appeared there were 3 waitresses that all sort of shared responsibility for our table which means no accountability if thingswent wrong and i think they all thought somebody else was handling it.but once our food was given to us... nobody ever came by to help us.to start, they didn't give us enough plates and we asked each waitress for it but it never came. (one person in our group literally had to use a napkin as a plate!)  they never checked to refill our banchan and everyone was hoping for more kimchi. one of the pieces of meat was dropped on the table before being cooked which i thought they would replace.. but they just slapped it on the grill.after the BBQ meat was cooked... one of the waitresses dumped it all on one of our dinner plates and then took the grill away never to be seen again.    i asked a waitress for some Gochujang (hot pepper paste) and 10minutes later i finally saw some other server place it on another table instead of ours. i would have liked another beer but nobody ever asked.  there were probably other items our group would have liked that i've forgotten... ok so bad service ..  but when they want to turn the table over to the next group.. i have never seen such efficiency!  they wanted my credit card ASAP and came back with it in 2 seconds flat!  and the busboys started crashing dishes into a cart and wiping up before i was even out of my chair.  i understood there was a line outside but give me 30 seconds people!one waitress sort of asked how everything was as she handed me the bill.  i politely told her of my list of disappointments and when she saw i wasn't happy... she went to get a different waitress.. like it wasn't her problem or she didn't want to hear it.  the next waitress did a great job of nodding her head and saying sorry but it didn't feel sincere. she just wanted us to leave. she kept saying.. ""next time.. sorry.. next time"".  not sure there will be a next time for me.  environment and service is important to me. yechon's service was terrible. seriously the worst! my wife forced me to leave a tip but i that will be the last money they see from me!"
Robert C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/21/2015,5.0,"Awesome spot to cure those Korean savorings that you've had for the last couple days.I love their salad that is topped with several types of sashimi. Yes, I realize that this isn't necessarily the most Korean dish, but it does come with all the typical Korean side dishes AKA bon chon.Another winner is their tofu soup. You can get this with different types of meat. I recommend the beef. It's a real winner.Be prepared for a line of people but hey, when you have good food and prices, what can be expected?"
Robert G.,"Herndon, VA",6/22/2017,4.0,"I looked up highly rated places in Annandale.  It led me here.  Thank goodness.  This was the very best  experience of this type I have ever had in my life...and I eat out a ton.  Someone else suggested the lunch special, and I will do the same here.  The cornucopia of items and flavors for that price point is utterly amazing.  All I can say is to give this place a shot.  Even if you end up not loving this style of food (some items were wonderful...some not to my taste), you will agree that the presentation and the amount of food choices are the best you may see in this type of setting.  And, you can tell by the crowd and the packed parking lot that this place has a substantial following.  Looking forward to going here at least once a month."
Nomin D.,"Springfield, VA",3/4/2015,3.0,"I'm giving three stars solely based upon food and minus two stars because of lack of customer service and organization of the restaurant itself. Their food is typical; nothing special compared to other korean restaurants in the area. They are little more pricier that others. But oh boy, the servers are just frustrating. Half the time, they take forever to bring you refill on side dishes... Takes wrong orders and blames you for not ordering correctly... They chase you out the door if you give them less than 15% because of lack of customer service.In addition, they don't take reservations at all which means waiting can be hour+ at times. And they are not attentive at all. I don't see why people are still hyping over this place. But I'm over it. I'll come if I have to, but not need to."
Dmitry D.,"Long Island, NY",1/11/2015,5.0,This place is good.  I thought this was going to be another honey pig but it wasn't.there must be a reason why everyone not just Koreans go here.At this place the menu is better suited for everyone. The wait staff speaks English can actually explain everything to you.our already most of them. The food was so good fresh with a bunch of little plates tat cone out with.which is actually every where. But w loved the atmosphere the sushi is so fresh and the seafood pancakes one big one really good crispy outside good amount of veggies and seafood on the inside. And for the amount of food it wasn't that expensive. We are going back soon and week try done more Korean favorites.Good bless the USA for the big variety of did places.
Eunha Y.,"Alexandria, VA",3/28/2016,3.0,"I'm writing this review after eating there 3 times. The food tastes good consistently. However, they get only 3 stars for the following reasons:1) Service is not too great. Friendly enough when you flag down someone. In all 3 visits, I couldn't get a refill on the water nor the side dishes unless I requested several times. 2) It seems busy and/or the waitresses are short staffed no matter what time we went. Lunch, Dinner, and weekend. Due to this reason, I highly recommend going there on weekdays & not right at lunch/dinner time. It's a 24 hour place. Only few items are available during mornings.3) At our last visit, fermented soy stew, Dwenjang Chigae, never came until the rest of us finished eating. One person never got to eat her lunch. We all just gave her a little bit of our food; Perhaps out of urgency to make the soup before we left, the stew arrived finally,  missing Tofu.  The waitress was willing to take it back to put some Tofu. But we were about to leave the restaurant. We were fully charged regardless of whether the soup was eaten or not. I don't want to talk you out of trying out this restaurant. Lunch menu price is reasonable. Taste is consistent, as I had already mentioned. I like the lovely Hanbok, traditional Korean dresses, the ladies wear. (Not in the morning.) Just be assertive when needing side dishes or water refilled. If not, you'll receive poor service & never want to return. And I hope everyone in your group gets to eat."
Bliss B.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",5/10/2016,1.0,"Rude waitresses!(Not all the waitresses though).  I stopped to go to this restaurant since the waitress was depending tips from us. I have been to this restaurant since 3 years ago because of my colleagues and my family  This restaurant is getting worse. A few waitresses are constantly very rude. When I visited yesterday, the waitress said that I should have left more tips for her. What?? You were not supposed to tell me. The manager used to be unfriendly too.  People keep coming to this restaurant since they open 24, but the service sucks including several waitresses and the manager. Be polite! Don't ask customers to leave more tips. Not back again ever!"
Kimberly W.,"Alexandria, VA",6/13/2016,2.0,"The worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant. We walked in and waited in line and the hostess repeatedly ignoring us. He went as far as putting other people on the guest list before us. When I bought the issue to his attention, he didn't apologize at all."
Christiane V.,"Vienna, VA",5/3/2016,3.0,"this place used to be my go to for korean food because of the variety, good service, price, and duh 24 hours.i haven't been in a while just because it was getting really crowded (always a +30 min wait at all times of the day), the parking lot was a mess, and i have korean friends who take me to other really good spots in ktown.i was craving their rice cake soup and stopped in the other night. they did a great job with the parking lot but increased their prices and made their portions smaller. i was a little disappointed to be honest."
Mike N.,"Clarksville, TN",1/10/2016,5.0,"This is my go-to Korean/Asian restaurant in NOVA. Everything tastes very good. Very efficient service though you might feel bit rushed if you're not used to their pace. Make sure to factor in some wait time especially during busy lunch hours. Lunch specials from $6.95, 1130 to 1430. Open 24 hours!"
Justine S.,"Annandale, VA",2/7/2015,4.0,"For a 24/7 restaurant, the quality of this place is great. Whether you're coming for lunch or after a night out, the taste & quality of the food stays consistent.The menu is quite vast and consists of a fusion of Japanese and Korean dishes from sushi, udon, and teriyaki to soondubu, Korean BBQ, and bibimbap, the sky's the limit!I always get the seafood pancake-- crispy, warm, and always a big hit amongst a group of friends, but as a warning, it's HUGE. Their special marinated pork BBQ is also a top contender-- it's spicy, succulent, and delicious.The assortment of banchan here is probably the best out of all the Korean restaurants in the area in my opinion. And virtually any dish is pretty much a hit! There is plenty of seating and once you order, the service is quick.It's never a regretful late night food run if I'm eating at Yechon!"
Dani P.,"Arlington, VA",2/18/2015,4.0,"I can't believe it's taken me so long to finally eat here. Oh wait, no I can. Parking has always been awful, and now construction eats up even more of the parking availability.Yechon is 24 hours, and it is busy for just about all of those hours. I went during the day when it wasn't AS busy. It was just before the recent snow, so my friend and I ordered soups. The soups are a good price, between $9-$15 depending on how fancy, but the bowls are big and the helpings are generous. They kept our glasses of hot tea flowing.I think it's easy to get lost in their menu. It's Korean and Japanese food, and the menu is a little too long for my taste. As long as all of the choices are tasty though, it's all good.It's conveniently right next to Breeze Bakery, so you can hop over and enjoy desert and coffee once you're done with your meal."
Yeleezka F.,"Fairfax, VA",2/3/2017,5.0,"If you don't mind pretending to speak and understand Korean, this place is awesome. Not the best service but the food is awesome and it's always always packed. The best Sushi I've had in a while."
Tom B.,"Washington, DC",5/31/2016,3.0,"Not sure what the hype is. Food was decent, service was lackluster, odd decor."
Jennifer N.,"Chantilly, VA",10/14/2015,2.0,"Umm is everyone else taking a special pill before eating here that makes the food taste magical? If so, can someone please pass some over to me? Because I thought the food here was average at best. Went here with the family during the week, but pretty late at night. The place was pretty empty with only 2-3 other tables with guests.  Service was non-existent. What good is that call button on the table if you're not going to actually come over when we utilize it?  It took forever to take our order and even longer to receive the meats. It's raw meat...how could it possible take long? Someone please explain. And then to get our check after the meal was done was nearly impossible. I had to literally get up and remind the waiter that we had requested for our check. Besides the terrible service, the food was overpriced and bland. It's also absurd that certain meats, such as my dearly beloved pork belly, could only be ordered in pairs. So if I wanted that meat, I had to order two plates of it when one plate already costs a ridiculous amount. Makes zero sense. The portion sizes were small and the flavor of meats were unimpressive."
Yasmeen Z.,"Fairfax, VA",6/28/2016,4.0,"Yechon is always a good time!! I love the short rib and bulgogi, and so many small yummy sides! The service is okay overall, I've had some nights were we get ignored and some that have been better, so I take a star off for that, but food is great, price is right, just generally a food dinner. Especially for a group and late night!"
